                synonym has been used publicly and deliberately (e.g. in a paper), it may also be listed in reports as a synonym. If the synonym was not used deliberately (e.g.
                there was a typo which went public), then the is_internal boolean may be set to -true- so that it is known that the synonym is -internal- and should be queryable
                but should not be listed in reports as a valid synonym.</comment>
