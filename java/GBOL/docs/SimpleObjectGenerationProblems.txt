Things that need to be fixed after generating the Abstract* classes:

1) There are some auto generated comment tags inserted in AbstractDBXref.hbm.xml that 
have "<" and ">" in them. Those screw up the hbm xml parsing and need to be 
removed or escaped or something.  

2) The current version of hibernate tools for some reason can't deal with class property 
mappings of columns called "version" for some reason. So in AbstractDBXref.hbm.xml, replace  

    <version name="version" type="string">
		<column name="version" not-null="true" />
	</version>

with

	<property name="version"/>

Also need to make that change in AbstractArrayDesign.hbm.xml
