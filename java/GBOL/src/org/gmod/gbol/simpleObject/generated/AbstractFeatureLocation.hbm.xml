        <comment>The location of a feature relative to another feature. Important: interbase coordinates are used. This is vital as it allows us to represent zero-length features
        e.g. splice sites, insertion points without an awkward fuzzy system. Features typically have exactly ONE location, but this need not be the case. Some features may not be
        localized (e.g. a gene that has been characterized genetically but no sequence or molecular information is available). Note on multiple locations: Each feature can have 0
        or more locations. Multiple locations do NOT indicate non-contiguous locations (if a feature such as a transcript has a non-contiguous location, then the subfeatures such
        as exons should always be manifested). Instead, multiple featurelocs for a feature designate alternate locations or grouped locations; for instance, a feature designating
        a blast hit or hsp will have two locations, one on the query feature, one on the subject feature. Features representing sequence variation could have alternate locations
        instantiated on a feature on the mutant strain. The column:rank is used to differentiate these different locations. Reflexive locations should never be stored - this is
        for -proper- (i.e. non-self) locations only; nothing should be located relative to itself.</comment>

                features; even if we do not want to instantiate a mutant chromosome/contig feature, we can still represent a SNP etc with 2 locations, one (rank 0) on the genome,

                <comment>This is used to manifest redundant, derivable extra locations for a feature. The default locgroup=0 is used for the DIRECT location of a feature.
                Important: most Chado users may never use featurelocs WITH logroup &gt; 0. Transitively derived locations are indicated with locgroup &gt; 0. For example, the
                position of an exon on a BAC and in global chromosome coordinates. This column is used to differentiate these groupings of locations. The default locgroup 0 is
                used for the main or primary location, from which the others can be derived via coordinate transformations. Another example of redundant locations is storing ORF
                coordinates relative to both transcript and genome. Redundant locations open the possibility of the database getting into inconsistent states; this schema gives us
                the flexibility of both warehouse instantiations with redundant locations (easier for querying) and management instantiations with no redundant locations. An
                example of using both locgroup and rank: imagine a feature indicating a conserved region between the chromosomes of two different species. We may want to keep
                redundant locations on both contigs and chromosomes. We would thus have 4 locations for the single conserved region feature - two distinct locgroups (contig level
                and chromosome level) and two distinct ranks (for the two species).</comment>

            <column name="rank" not-null="true">
                <comment>Used when a feature has &gt;1 location, otherwise the default rank 0 is used. Some features (e.g. blast hits and HSPs) have two locations - one on the
                query and one on the subject. Rank is used to differentiate these. Rank=0 is always used for the query, Rank=1 for the subject. For multiple alignments, assignment
                of rank is arbitrary. Rank is also used for sequence_variant features, such as SNPs. Rank=0 indicates the wildtype (or baseline) feature, Rank=1 indicates the
                mutant (or compared) feature.</comment>
