def: "The cellular process by which a physical entity or change in state, a signal, is created that originates in one cell and is used to transfer information to another cell. This process begins with the initial formation of the signal and ends with the mature form and placement of the signal." [GOC:dph]

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.
