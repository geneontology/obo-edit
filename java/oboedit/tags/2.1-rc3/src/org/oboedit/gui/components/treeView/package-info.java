 * The Tree Viewer package. The Tree Viewer displays a tree style representation of
 * the graph running up to the ontology root, and down to the term or terms 
 * selected in the Ontology Tree Editor. All possible paths from leaf node to root 
 * are shown in this view, and the graph is not editable in this component.
 * 
 * Configuration of this component happens via the standard wrench icon, with settings held in a JavaBean class and accessed using the same flow
 * as shown in the Graphviz Viewer component diagram at org.oboedit.gui.components.graphvizViewer.doc-files.GraphvizConfiguration.png.
