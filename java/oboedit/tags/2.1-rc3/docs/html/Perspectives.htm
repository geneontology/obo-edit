<p>
Layouts in OBO-Edit are referred to as Perspectives.  OBO-Edit offers several built-in
perspectives and also allows users to customize their own perspectives (which can then
be saved and shared with other users).
The menu options for perspectives are in the Layouts menu.</p>
<h3>Built-In Perspectives:  Edit and Verify</h3>
<p>There are two built-in perspectives called Edit and Verify. The Edit perspective
is optimized for ontology editing:
</p><p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/edit_perspective.png" center border=0></p>
<p>The Verify perspective allows you to
easily check various features of the ontology such as comment syntax:
</p><p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/verify_perspective.png" center border=0>
</p>
<h3>Creating Your Own Perspective</h3>
<p>
In addition to these built-in perspectives you can create your own favorite perspective, save it,
and (if desired) share the resulting configuration file with other people. 
You can set up your desired perspective by using the menus to add components and/or
the "X" icons on currently displayed components to remove them from the display. 
</p><p>
Components can be moved around by grabbing their title bars and
dragging them around.  As you drag a panel, you will see a black outline that shows where it
will land if you drop it.</p>
<h4>Docking and Undocking Components</h4>
<p>You can turn a panel into an independent window
(i.e., undock it) by clicking the icon
of an arrow that points upwards and to the right:
</p><p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/undocked.png" center border=0></p>
<p>To return a panel to the
main OBO-Edit window (i.e., dock it), click its icon that shows an arrow pointing downwards and
to the left.
</p>
<h3>Saving and Sharing Perspectives</h3>
<p>
First set up your perspective by adding or removing panels and dragging them to your preferred locations.
Then save the perspective (using [Layouts]->[Save current perspective as..]).  (Your perspective
will now show up in the list of perspectives when you access the Layouts menu.)
</p></p>
To find your perspectives file to share with other users, go to your configuration directory
and look inside the perspectives subdirectory for the appropriate .idw file.
If you don't know where your configuration directory is, you can find out by opening the <a href="Configuration_Manager.htm">Configuration
    Manager</a>.
It is not possible to edit the perspectives file by hand, but you can mail the
file around to let others use your favorite perspective.</p>
<p>
To import a perspective, use [Layout] -> [Import perspective...].  The perspective name will be derived from the filename (e.g., if the file is called "new-perspective.idw", the perspective will be called "new-perspective").</p>
