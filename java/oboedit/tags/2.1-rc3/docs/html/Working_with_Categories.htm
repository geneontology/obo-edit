<h1>Working with Subsets</h1>
<p>  Every OBO ontology contains a set of 
categories. Terms in the ontology can be assigned to one of the 
<em>categories</em> in that set (see <A 
href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm">An Introduction to OBO 
Ontologies</A>, and <A href="Text_Editing.htm">Text Editing</A>&nbsp;for more information on how to assign entities to 
categories).</p>
<p>The built-in Subset Manager allows users to manage the set of 
available categories. To access the Subset Manager, choose "Subset 
Manager" from the menu under [Metadata].

<h2>Committing Changes</h2>
<p>Any changes made in the Subset Manager are not saved until the 
"Save Changes" button is clicked. If changes are made and the window is closed, 
<strong>the changes will not be saved</strong>. To revert to the last committed 
version of the subset set, click the "Revert" button.</p>
<h2>Editing An Existing Subset</h2>
<p>To edit an existing subset, click the subset to edit in the list on the 
left. The subset editor panel will appear:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/subset_manager_editor.png" border=0></p>
<p>Categories have two attributes: a short identifying name 
and a longer descriptive name. To change the subset name, click 
the&nbsp;subset name&nbsp;in the text field and type a new name. To change the 
descriptive name, click the subset description in the text field and type a new description.</p>
<h2>Deleting an Existing Subset</h2>
<p>To delete an existing subset, click the subset to delete in the list on 
the left. Click the Del button to remove the subset.</p>
<p>  Note that a subset that is assigned to a term cannot be 
deleted. If a subset is deleted that is still in use, a warning will appear 
when the "Save Changes" button is pressed. If a subset must be deleted, first 
<A href="Searching.htm">search</A> the ontology to make sure that the subset 
is not in use.</p>
<h2>Adding a New Subset</h2>
<p>To add a new subset, click the "Add" button. A new subset will be created with the default name 
"NEWSUBSET" and the default description "&lt;new term subset&gt;".
Edit the&nbsp;name and description&nbsp;as described above.</p>
