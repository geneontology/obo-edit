<h1>The Ontology Change Tracker</h1>
<p>The Ontology Change Tracker examines two ontologies 
and produces the list of edits that would be necessary to change the first 
ontology into the second. Normally, this tool is used on an old version and a 
new version of the same ontology to see what changes have occurred between 
versions.</p>
<p>The Ontology Change Tracker is accessed from the 
"Tools" menu:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 
src="../images/change_tracker.png" border=0></p>
<p>At the top of the panel are two sections labeled "Old 
Ontology" and "New Ontology". To load an ontology into one of these sections, 
either use the "Use current ontology" or "Load ontology..." buttons.</p>
<p>To use the currently loaded ontology as one of the 
comparison ontologies, press the "Use current ontology". To load an ontology 
from a data adapter, press the "Load ontology..." button. A load dialog will 
appear. Use the load dialog to load an ontology&nbsp;as described in <A 
href="Loading___Saving.htm">Loading &amp; Saving</A>.</p>
<p>Once an ontology has been loaded into both the "Old 
Ontology" and "New Ontology" sections, the "Find Changes" button at the bottom 
becomes active. Press the "Find Changes" button to find the differences between 
the two ontologies. A progress bar will appear at the bottom of the screen as 
the analysis takes place (this can take a few minutes if the ontologies are 
large or there are many changes).</p>
<p>The results of the analysis appear in the middle of the 
panel:</p>
<p><IMG  hspace=0 
src="../images/change_tracker_detail.png" border=0></p>
<p>This panel displays the list of changes in a tree view, 
similar to the view used in <A href="The_History_Plugin.htm">the History 
Browser</A>.</p>
<p>Note that if you load an ontology into OBO-Edit, make 
some changes, and then use the Ontology Change Tracker to compare the 
currently loaded ontology against the originally loaded file, the results will 
probably <em>not</em> exactly match the current edits displayed in <A 
href="The_History_Plugin.htm">the History Browser</A>. At first glance, this 
should seem strange, since both tools should be aware of the same set of 
changes. Both tools are displaying the a list of edits that are 
<em>logically</em> equivalent. However, the History Browser groups the edits 
based on the user's activity. The Ontology Change Tracker is constructing the 
list of edits based solely on the contents of two ontologies; it can't tell if a 
user used the "Move" command, or whether they did a "Copy" and then later a 
"Delete". Therefore, the Ontology Change Tracker will typically display a 
much sparer list of edits than <A href="The_History_Plugin.htm">the History 
Browser</A>.</p>
<p>Once the changes have been found, they can be saved to a 
file by pressing the "Save Changes" button. A dialog will appear as described in 
<A href="Saving_a_History_File.htm">Saving a History File</A>.</p>
