<h1>The Dbxref Library</h1>
<p>The Dbxref Library allows users to keep a 
database of frequently used dbxrefs to save the effort of typing long or obscure 
dbxrefs each time they want to add a dbxref to a term or a definition.</p>

<h2>Loading a Dbxref Library</h2>
<p>A dbxref library file is simply a text file with one dbxref on each line.
  Usually dbxrefs have a database identifier, a colon, and a term identifier
  (e.g., GOC:cr), but sometimes they are a URL or a text string. Optionally,
each dbxref can have a description after the db:ID, e.g., "MetaCyc:PWY-881
Cell Cycle, Mitotic".
</p>
<p>To load a dbxref library, foollow the instructions for "Modifying
the Library" or using the "Import dbxrefs" button, both described
below.</p><p>The list of dbxrefs is sorted by description (if any) and then by
db:ID. Any dbxrefs that have a description will appear before those with no description.</p>

<h2>Adding Dbxrefs to Terms</h2>
<p>To add a dbxref from the library to one or more terms, select the dbxref from 
the list.  Press the "Add as dbxref" or "Add
as def dbxref" button to add the selected dbxref to the currently selected
  term (the one that is shown in the Text Editor).  If you want to add dbxrefs
  to multiple terms, select the desired terms in an Ontology Tree Editor that
  is in global selection mode, and check the "Apply to all selected terms"
  checkbox before pressing one of the Add buttons.
</p>

<h2>Modifying the Library</h2>
<p>To add new dbxrefs or remove items from the list, 
press the "Configure dbxrefs" button. The Dbxref Library configuration window 
will appear:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 
src="../images/dbxref_library_config.png" border=0></p>
<p>This window contains a dbxref editor list that works much like a <A
href="Text_Editing.htm#dbxref">dbxref tab</A>, except that a dbxref is
selected by a single click. See <A href="Text_Editing.htm#dbxref">Text
Editing</A> for more information on the fields. Press "Save
configuration" to save your changes.</p>

<h2>Sharing Your Library</h2>
<p>Dbxref libraries can be saved to an external file. Dbxref 
lists can be imported into other installations of OBO-Edit.</p>
<p>To export your dbxref list to a file, press the "Export 
dbxrefs" button. A file browser window will appear where a save file can be 
specified.</p>

<p>To import a dbxref list from a file, press the "Import dbxrefs"
button. A file browser window will appear where a file can be chosen
off the disk.&nbsp;Beware! The imported dbxrefs will <em>replace</em>
the existing dbxref library.</p>
