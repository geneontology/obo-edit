<H1>OBO-Edit-Specific Variables</H1>
<P>Different script parameters are passed to scripts in 
different contexts. This page describes the global variables and script 
parameters available to OSL scripts in OBO-Edit.</P>
<H2>Don't Modify Active OBO-Edit Sessions!</H2>
<P>OSL scripts have complete power to modify the OBO-Edit data objects. A badly 
coded OSL script can destroy an ontology or leave an ontology in an inconsistent 
state that will crash OBO-Edit. Be careful.</P>
<P>It is possible to modify an ontology using obo2obo&nbsp;without courting a 
major disaster. However,&nbsp;<STRONG>never</STRONG> modify an ontology during 
an active OBO-Edit session. OBO-Edit expects ontology edits to happen via a 
strict protocol. Direct modifications to the OBO-Edit datamodel will always 
leave OBO-Edit in an unstable, damaged&nbsp;state.</P>
<P>Furture versions of OSL may not even allow direct modification of datamodels 
from OBO-Edit.</P>
<H2>obo2obo</H2>
<P>When a script is run by obo2obo, the following global variables are always 
available:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A 
  href="../../apidocs/org/geneontology/oboedit/script/ScriptUtil.html"><STRONG>Util</STRONG></A> - Defines a few utility methods for 
  creating Java objects. 
  <LI><A 
  href="../../apidocs/org/geneontology/oboedit/script/TermUtilScriptDelegate.html"><STRONG>TermUtil</STRONG></A> - Defines utility methods for 
  working with OBO-Edit terms, links and properties 
  <LI><A 
  href="../../apidocs/org/geneontology/oboedit/datamodel/OBOSession.html"><STRONG>session</STRONG></A> - The currently loaded ontology. Any 
  modifications made to this ontology will be written to the output file.
  <LI>args - A list of the strings passed to the script as arguments from the 
  command line.</LI></UL>
<H2>OBO-Edit</H2>
<P>When a script is run by OBO-Edit, the following global variables are always 
available:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A 
  href="../../apidocs/org/geneontology/oboedit/script/ScriptUtil.html"><STRONG>Util</STRONG></A> - Defines a few utility methods for 
  creating Java objects. 
  <LI><A 
  href="../../apidocs/org/geneontology/oboedit/script/TermUtilScriptDelegate.html"><STRONG>TermUtil</STRONG></A> - Defines utility methods for 
  working with OBO-Edit terms, links and properties 
  <LI><A 
  href="../../apidocs/org/geneontology/oboedit/script/GUIScriptDelegate.html"><STRONG>GUI</STRONG></A> 
  - Provides access to the OBO-Edit gui, including the currently loaded 
  ontology, the current selection, and other information.</LI></UL>
<P>Other local script parameters are available in specific contexts inside 
OBO-Edit.</P>
<H3>Filter-Specific Variables</H3>
<P>Whenever a <A href="Backtick_Expressions.htm">backtick expression</A>&nbsp;is 
used in a filter, the following variable is&nbsp;available:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A 
  href="../../apidocs/org/geneontology/oboedit/datamodel/impl/LinkedAnnotatedObjectImpl.html"><STRONG>current</STRONG></A> 
  - The term currently being examined by the filtering system. A backtick 
  expression in a filter will be evaluated over and over again for each object 
  in the ontology. The <FONT face=Courier>current</FONT> variable is a reference 
  to the ontology object that is currently being examined.</LI></UL>
