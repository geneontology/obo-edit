href="How_OBO_Edit_Understands_Histories.htm">How OBO-Edit Understands 
Histories</A>.
<p>Note that you can't Undo changes made in the Text Editor until you've
committed them by clicking the Commit button (if you are in manual commit
  mode) or by selecting a different ontology term (if you are in auto-commit mode).
