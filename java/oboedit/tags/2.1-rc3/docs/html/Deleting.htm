<h1>Deleting</h1>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by</strong>: Edit menu, right-click</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: Del</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: One or more source relationships 
required</p>
<p><strong>Target requirement</strong>: No target required</p>
</div>

<p>The Delete operation removes a relationship from the ontology. If a
term has more than one parent, Delete removes one relationship at a
time. If a term has only one parent, deleting the last relationship
makes the term obsolete.</p>

<p>To delete one or more relationships, first <a
href="Working_with_Selections.htm">select</a> the relationship(s) to
be deleted. Choose the "Delete relationship" option from the edit menu
or right-click menu. You can use the Delete operation to delete more
than one relationship at once: Delete affects all selected
relationships, provided that they can all be deleted (see below for
the exception).</p>

<p> When a term has only one parent, the menu item will say "Delete term (make obsolete)", and if
you delete it, a warning will appear:

<p>If you click "Yes" the term will become obsolete; if you click "No"
no action is taken.</p>

<p>Note that if a term has children, it cannot be made obsolete; the
children must be removed (moved or deleted) first. If you select a
term that has one parent and one or more children, the Delete menu
item will not be available (it will be greyed out). If you select more
than one term, and one of the selected terms has one parent and one or
more children, a warning will appear indicating that the term with
children will not be deleted:</p>

<p><img src="../images/delete_children_warning.png" border=0></p>

<p>If you click "Yes" the terms without children will be deleted (and
made obsolete if they have no other parents, as in the figure); if you
click "No" no action is taken. In either case the term with children
is not deleted.</p>
