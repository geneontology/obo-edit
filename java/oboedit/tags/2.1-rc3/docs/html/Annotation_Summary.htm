<p>
The Annotation Summary Component is only useful if you have loaded annotations.
There are three ways to do this:
<ul>
<li> By using the component in another application such as Phenote<br>
<li> by loading annotations using the new [Annotation] stanza (not yet finalized)<br>
<li> by waiting for the GO association file adapter to be added to the adapter
options (the underlying code is written)
</ul>
