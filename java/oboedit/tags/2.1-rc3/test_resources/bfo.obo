comment: Examples: the disposition of vegetables to decay when not refrigerated, the disposition of a vase to brake if dropped, the disposition of blood to coagulate, the disposition of a patient with a weakened immune system to contract disease, the disposition of metal to conduct electricity.

comment: Definition: A independent continuant that is spatially extended, maximally self-connected and self-contained (the parts of a substance are not separated from each other by spatial gaps) and possesses an internal unity. The identity of substantial objects is independent of that of other entities and can be maintained through time and through loss and gain of parts and qualities.

id: snap:ObjectBoundary

comment: Definition: An independent continuant that is a lower dimensional part of a spatial entity, normally a closed two-dimensional surface. Boundaries are those privileged parts of objects that exist at exactly the point where the object is separated off from the rest of the existing entities in the world.
comment: Examples: the surface of the skin, the surface of the earth, the surface of the interior of the stomach, the outer surface of a cell or cell wall
comment: Synonyms: substance boundary
comment: Comment: Boundaries are theoretically difficult entities to account for, however the intuitive notion of a physical boundary as a surface of some sort (whether inside or outside of a thing) will generally serve as a good guide for the use of this universal.

comment: Definition: An independent continuant consisting of a characteristic spatial shape in relation to some arrangement of other continuants and of the medium which is enclosed in whole or in part by this characteristic spatial shape. Sites are entities that can be occupied by other continuants.
comment: Examples: a city, a nasal cavity, a blood vein, an environment, sinuses, canals, ventricles, the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, the location of the battle of Austerlitz, the interior of the aorta, the room in which one is located, the top of one&#8217;s desk including the things that are on it and the atmosphere surrounding them.
comment: Comment: Sites should not be confused with spatial regions. Sites characteristically have a filling or medium and are capable of altering their spatial location (moving from one spatial region to another) without altering their identity.

Occurrents exist in space and time in a different way from that in which continuants do and thus the space and time in which they exist is itself different. Spatiotemporal region&#8217;s importance is primarily theoretical and it will not be used often in most domain ontology applications.
