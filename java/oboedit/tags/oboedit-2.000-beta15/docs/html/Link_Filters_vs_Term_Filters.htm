<H1>Link Filters vs Term Filters</H1>
<P>There are two kinds of filters in OBO-Edit: <STRONG>term 
filters</STRONG> and <STRONG>link filters</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Term filters</STRONG> match ontology "terms". Things like relations, 
instances and classes can be matched by a term filter.</P>
<P><STRONG>Link filters</STRONG> match links <EM>between</EM> terms. This does 
<EM>not</EM> mean that a link filter matches two terms. A link filter will never 
match any terms. It will only match&nbsp;links between terms.</P>
<P>A link can be thought of as a triplet that consists of a child term, a 
relationship type, and a parent term. This guide uses the following notation for 
describing a link: <STRONG>[child term] --[type]--&gt; [parent term]</STRONG>. 
An is_a link between "organ growth" and "growth" would be written as: 
<STRONG>"organ growth" --<EM>is_a</EM>--&gt; 
"growth"</STRONG>.</P>
