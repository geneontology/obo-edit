<h1>The Verification Plugin</h1>
<p>The Verification Plugin allows users control over all 
aspects of the verification system:</p>
<p><IMG height=379 hspace=0 
src="../images/verification_plugin.gif" width=712 border=0></p>
<p>The Verification Plugin is based around two tabs, the 
<strong>Configuration</strong> tab and the <strong>Verification Results</strong> tab.</p>
<h2>The Configuration Tab</h2>
<p>The top half of the configuration tab contains a list of 
checks. Each line contains the check name, a series of checkboxes indicating the 
events at which this check will be run, and an optional configuration button. To 
specify when a check should be run, check the boxes for each event for which the 
check should be performed.</p>
<p>In the middle of the panel is a series of checkboxes 
labeled "Show warnings". Warnings (non-fatal error messages generated by an 
ontology check)&nbsp;are only displayed during events that are checked in this 
panel.</p>
<p>Beneath this panel is a checkbox labeled "Check 
obsoletes?". If this box is selected, checks are run on obsolete terms. If it is 
not selected, obsolete terms are ignored.</p>
<p>Under this is a pair of buttons labeled "Add check" and 
"Remove check". If "Add check" is clicked, the User Check Editor is diplayed 
(see below). If "Remove check" is clicked, the currently selected check will be 
deleted. Only user defined checks can be deleted; built in checks cannot be 
removed, but they can be disabled by selecting no events for that check.</p>
<p>At the bottom is the "Run Manual Check" button. Clicking 
this button triggers the <strong>manual</strong> event, and all checks that are 
marked "On manual?" will be run.</p>
<h3>       
    Built-In Checks</h3>
<p>      The 
following checks are built-in to OBO-Edit:</p>
<ul>
  <li><A href="Text_Checks.htm">Comment Check</A> 
  <li><A href="Definition_Check.htm">Definition Check</A> 
  <li><A href="Text_Checks.htm">Name Check</A> 
  <li><A href="Text_Checks.htm">Synonym Check</A> 
  <li><A href="Dangling_Intersection_Check.htm">Dangling Intersection Check</A> 
  <li><A href="Dbxref_Check.htm">Dbxref Check</A> 
  <li><A href="Disjointedness_Check.htm">Disjointedness Check</A> 
  <li><A href="ISA_Cycle_Check.htm"> Cycle Check</A> 
  <li><A href="Name_Redundancy_Check.htm">Name Redundancy Check</A> 
  <li><A href="User_Defined_Checks.htm">User Defined Checks</A> </li></ul>
<h3>User Defined Checks</h3>
<p><A name=userdefined></A>Each user-defined check is associated with a term filter. 
If the filter matches any term in the ontology, the check fails and an error is 
reported to the verification system.</p>
<p>To create a user-defined filter, click the "Add check" 
button. When the "Add Check" button is clicked, the User Check Editor 
appears:</p>
<p><IMG height=257 hspace=0 
src="../images/verification_plugin_user_filter.gif" width=461 border=0></p>
<p>The "Check name" field contains the name of the 
user-defined check.</p>
<p>Below the "Check name" field is a filter editor. This 
editor contains the filter that will be used to determine whether a term passes 
or fails this check. The filter should be designed so that any term that matches 
this filter fails the check.</p>
<p>Beneath this is the "Message suffix" text field. This 
field contains the ending of the error message that will be generated for terms 
that fail this check. The error message has the form "Term &lt;term name&gt; 
&lt;message suffix&gt;".</p>
<p>The final control is the "Is fatal" checkbox. If this box 
is selected, errors generated by this check are treated as fatal errors. An 
ontology that generates fatal errors when checked cannot be saved until the 
errors are corrected. If this box is not selected, error messages are treated as 
non-fatal warnings.</p>
<p>Once the check is configured, save&nbsp;the new configuration&nbsp;by clicking 
"Ok".</p>
<h2>Verification Results</h2>
<p>Whenever a verification is run for any reason, the results appear in the 
<strong>Verification Results</strong> tab:</p>
<p><IMG height=445 hspace=0 src="../images/verification_plugin_results.gif" 
width=581 border=0></p>
<p>Note that often the verification results will also appear in a popup window, 
but the results of the last verification can always be reviewed in this tab of 
the verification plugin. Verification results appear in a popup window when the 
verification is triggered by a special event, such as a text edit, save, load, 
or reasoner-startup.</p>
<p>The results tab will contain a list of errors and warnings. Errors are severe 
problems with the ontology that must be corrected to make the ontology compliant 
with the OBO ontology format. Warnings are less serious problems that should be 
corrected, but the ontology can be saved even if these errors are not dealt 
with.</p>
<p>Warnings are preceded by&nbsp;a <IMG height=16 hspace=0 
src="../images/warning.gif" width=16 border=0>&nbsp;icon. Errors are preceded by 
a <IMG height=16 hspace=0 src="../images/error.gif" width=16 
border=0>&nbsp;icon. Errors are generally listed first.</p>
<p>Warnings and error messages are grouped together by term, so that all 
warnings generated for a particular term appear together. If a term is mentioned 
in an error message or warning, the term name is a clickable hyperlink. Clicking 
the hyperlink causes that term to be selected. Note that these hyperlinks will 
not work if the verification results are displayed in an automatic popup window, 
but the window can be closed and the results plugin opened. The verification 
results will be visible in the results tab, and the hyperlinks will be clickable 
there.</p>
<H3>Quick Fix</H3>
<p><A name=quickfix></A>Sometimes, a warning or error will be followed by a <IMG height=16 hspace=0 
src="../images/quickfix.gif" width=16 border=0>&nbsp;icon. When this icon 
appears, it means one or more "quick fixes" are available for the problem. When 
the icon is clicked, a popup menu will appear detailing the various quick fix 
options. To apply one of the quick fixes, select it from the menu. Normally, the 
fix will be applied and the verification will be at least partly re-run to 
reflect the changes made by the quick fix. <strong>Beware: quick fixes may 
modify your ontology.</strong></p>
