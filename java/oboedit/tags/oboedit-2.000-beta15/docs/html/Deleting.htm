<h1>Deleting</h1>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by</strong>: Edit menu, right-click</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: Del</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: One or more source relationships 
required</p>
<p><strong>Target requirement</strong>: No target required</p>
</div>
<p>The Delete operation removes a relationship from the 
ontology. When a term's last parent relationship is Deleted, the term becomes obsolete. If a term has children, it cannot be deleted; the children must be removed first.</p>
<p>To delete one or more relationships, first select the relationships to be 
deleted. Choose the "Delete" option from the edit menu or right-click menu. The 
relationships will be removed, and - if appropriate - orphaned terms will be 
marked obsolete.</p>
<p>The Delete operation can also be used to make a root term obsolete. To 
obsolete a root term, select the term, and choose "Delete" from the right-click 
or edit menu.</p>
