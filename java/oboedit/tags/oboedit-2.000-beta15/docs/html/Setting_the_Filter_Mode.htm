<H1>Setting the Filter Design Mode</H1>
<P>There are a number of filter design modes in OBO-Edit. Filters are used 
throughout OBO-Edit; sometimes the filter design mode can be specified by the 
user, and sometimes the design mode is locked. (The latter case tends to be seen 
in complex controls where a lot of fine control is needed; in these cases, the 
filter design controls are usually locked into the most advanced settings).</P>
<P>When the filter design mode is user configurable, the design mode can be set 
by clicking the "Advanced" tab of the filter designer. For example, by default, 
OBO-Edit's search control looks like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;<IMG height=152 hspace=0 src="../images/filter_keyword.gif" width=408 
border=0> </P>
<P>If you click the "Advanced" tab, the advanced interface appears:</P>
<P>&nbsp;<IMG height=152 hspace=0 src="../images/filter_advanced_tab.gif" 
width=408 border=0> </P>
<P>By clicking combinations of the checkboxes in this 
panel, you can select the filter design mode. The meanings of these checkboxes are discussed in 
the following sections.</P>
