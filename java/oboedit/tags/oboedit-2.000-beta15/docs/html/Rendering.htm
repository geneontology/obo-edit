<H1>Rendering</H1>
<P>Rendering allows a user to specify special colors, fonts, 
and other visual effects to terms in a ontology editor panel that match a particular 
filter.</P>
<P>To enable rendering, click "Rendering controls" in the 
"Advanced" tab of the search panel. When rendering is enabled, the search panel looks like this:</P>
<P><IMG height=150 hspace=0 src="../images/render_term.gif" 
width=478 border=0>        
               </P>
<P>        
   There are two new controls, the "Render options" pane and the "Render" button.</P>
<P>To create a new renderer, first design a filter in the 
filter designer to the left. Then, specify one or more visual effects to apply to matching 
terms. To apply the new renderer to the primary ontology editor panel, press the "Render" button.</P>
<P>  With the settings shown in the 
screenshot above, the ontology editor panel will draw any term whose name contains "activity" in red:</P>
<P><IMG height=229 hspace=0 
src="../images/render_editor_panel.gif" width=297 border=0></P>
<P>A ontology editor panel can have any number of renderers at 
the same time.</P>
<H2>Specifying Renderer Options</H2>
<P>Renderers can apply several different visual effects to 
matching terms. The available effects are different for term filters and link 
filters.</P>
<P>In general, to apply a visual effect, select the checkbox 
next to it. If a visual effect is configurable, a configuration control will 
appear next to the checkbox once it is selected. A renderer may apply several 
visual effects to a matching term.</P>
<H3>Term Renderer Effects</H3>
<P>Term renderer effects change the way a term name is 
displayed in the ontology editor panel. The following renderer effects are available 
for term filters:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Change Color</STRONG> - The "Change Color" 
  effect changes the color of terms that match the filter. If the "Change Color" 
  checkbox is checked, a button will appear next to the checkbox showing the 
  color that will be applied to matching terms. To choose a different color, 
  click the button. A color selection window will appear where you can choose a 
  different color for matching terms.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Change Font</STRONG> - The "Change Font" 
  effect changes the typeface of terms that match the filter. If the "Change 
  Font" checkbox is checked, a dropdown list of available fonts will appear next 
  to the checkbox. Select the font you would like to apply to matching 
  terms.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Change Size</STRONG> - The "Change Size" 
  effect changes the type size of terms that match the filter. If the "Change 
  Size" checkbox is checked, a text field appears next to the checkbox. Type the 
  desired text size into the text field.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Make Bold</STRONG> - The "Make Bold" effect 
  makes matching terms appear in a bold typeface. There are no special 
  configuration controls for this effect.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Make Italic</STRONG> - The "Make Italic" 
  effect makes matching terms appear in a italic typeface. There are no special 
  configuration controls for this effect.</DIV></LI></UL>
<H3>Link Renderer Effects</H3>
<P>Link renderer effects change the way the arrow between a 
term and its parent (<IMG height=14 hspace=0 src="../images/link_arrow.gif" 
width=80 border=0>) is displayed in the ontology editor panel. The following 
renderer effects are available:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Change Color</STRONG> - The "Change Color" 
  effect changes the color of the link arrow for links that match the filter. If 
  the "Change Color" checkbox is checked, a button will appear next to the 
  checkbox showing the color that will be applied to matching links. To choose a 
  different color, click the button. A color selection window will appear where 
  you can choose a different color for matching terms.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Change Line Type</STRONG> - The "Change Line 
  Type" effect changes the way the link arrow line is drawn. If the "Change Line 
  Type" checkbox is checked, a dropdown box will appear next to the checkbox 
  showing the available line types. The available options are "SOLID", "WAVY" 
  and "DASHED".</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Change Line Width</STRONG> - The "Change Line 
  Width" effect changes the thickness of the link arrow line. If the "Change 
  Line Width" checkbox is checked, a text field will appear next to the 
  checkbox. Type the desired line width (in pixels) into the text 
  field.</DIV></LI></UL>
<H2>Choosing which ontology editor panel to Render</H2>
<P>When the "Render" button is pressed, the renderer is 
applied to the primary ontology editor panel. To apply a renderer to a ontology editor 
panel other than the primary ontology editor panel, drag and drop the&nbsp;render 
button onto the desired ontology editor panel. The&nbsp;renderer 
will be applied to the target panel.</P>
<H2>Multiple Renderers at Once</H2>
<P>Any number of renderers may be applied to a ontology editor panel at once. If a 
term matches multiple renderers, OBO-Edit will try to merge the renderer effects 
to display as much information as possible.</P>
<P>OBO-Edit can merge renderer effects of different types. If one renderer wants 
to make a term red, and another wants to make a term bold, OBO-Edit will show 
the term in red and in bold. But OBO-Edit cannot merge effects of the same type. 
If one renderer wants to make a term red and another wants to make the term 
blue, OBO-Edit will only display a single color.</P>
<P>When two renderers specify two different values for the same effect, OBO-Edit 
chooses the value from the most recently added renderer.</P>
<P>Therefore, if you plan to use several renderers at once, it is usually a good 
idea to use a different type of renderer effect for each renderer. That way it 
is easy to tell if a term matches multiple renderers.</P>
<H2>Removing Renderers</H2>
<P>To remove a filter, click the <EM>filter menu button </EM><IMG height=20 
hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_filter_button.gif" width=20 border=0> 
&nbsp;beneath the ontology editor panel from which you would like to remove the 
filter.&nbsp;The&nbsp;filter menu will appear:</P>
<P><IMG height=73 hspace=0 src="../images/render_menu.gif" width=187 
border=0>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To remove all renderers, choose the "Remove all renderers" or "Remove all 
renderers and filters" item.</P>
<P>To remove a specific renderer, select "Remove specific renderer". A list of 
the current renderers will appear in a flyout menu. Select a renderer from the 
menu to remove it.</P>
