<H1> Cycle Check</H1>
<P>This check&nbsp;reports an error if&nbsp;illegal cycles 
are found in the ontology. A cycle is a chain of one or more links that makes a 
term an ancestor of itself. A cycle is illegal if there is an explicit or implied cycle over a relationship 
type that is not marked "cyclic".</P>
<P>This check always runs, but it can only find implied cycles if the reasoner 
is enabled.</P>
