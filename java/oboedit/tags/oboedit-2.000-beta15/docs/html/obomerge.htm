<h1>obomerge</h1>
<p>The obomerge utility can merge the changes in two 
different versions of a file. Three files are needed: an original unchanged 
version of the file, a version of the file with one set of changes, and a 
version of the file with another set of changes.</p>
<p>obomerge uses the OBO-Edit <A 
href="How_OBO_Edit_Understands_Histories.htm">history system</a>&nbsp;to merge 
the changes, so this tool&nbsp;produces accurate results&nbsp;every time, 
unlike, for example, a text-based merge.</p>
<p>The command usage is:</p>
<pre><strong>     
  obomerge \
    [-ignore-clash-on-id &lt;value1&gt; -ignore-clash-on-id &lt;value2&gt; ... -ignore-clash-on-id  &lt;valueN&gt;] \
    [-update-ids-when (NEVER | IF_LIKELY | ALWAYS)] [-fail-on-clash (ALWAYS | IF_LIKELY | NEVER)] \
    -original &lt;value&gt; -revision &lt;value1&gt; -revision &lt;value2&gt; -o &lt;value&gt;</strong>     
    
       
         
    </pre>
<p>The required command line parameters are:</p>
<UL>
  <li><strong>&lt;original file&gt;</strong> - The original obo file that both 
  &lt;changed file 1&gt; and &lt;changed file 2&gt;&nbsp;are based on
  <li><strong>&lt;changed file 1&gt;</strong> - A version of &lt;original 
  file&gt; with some set of changes
  <li><strong>&lt;changed file 2&gt;</strong> - A version of &lt;original 
  file&gt; with some set of changes. It's okay if&nbsp;some of the&nbsp;same 
  changes were made in &lt;changed file 1&gt; and &lt;changed file 2&gt;.
  <li><strong>&lt;merged file&gt;</strong> - The file where the merged changes 
  from &lt;changed file 1&gt; and &lt;changed file 2&gt;.</li></UL>
<P>The optional command line parameters are </P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>-ignore-clash-on-id &lt;id&gt;</STRONG>&nbsp;- Indicates to ignore 
  an id clash on this id and proceed with the merge.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>-update-ids-when (NEVER | IF_LIKELY | ALWAYS)</STRONG> - If the 
  value given is NEVER, ids are never updated. If the value given is IF_LIKELY, 
  ids are update in the event of a likely clash (a clash where the term names 
  are different), but not an unlikely clash (where ids clash but the term names 
  are the same). The the value given is ALWAYS, ids are updated in the event of 
  a likely or unlikely clash.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>-fail-on-clash (ALWAYS | IF_LIKELY | NEVER)</STRONG> - If the 
  value given is ALWAYS, obomerge always fails if an id clash is detected. If 
  the value is IF_LIKELY, obomerge fails if a likely clash (where term names are 
  different) is detected. If the value is NEVER, obomerge will always continue 
  even when id clashes are detected.</LI></UL>
<p>Note that &lt;original file&gt; MUST be an early version 
of <strong>both</strong> &lt;changed file 1&gt; and &lt;changed file 2&gt;. 
Without a usable original file, obomerge cannot determine what changes were made 
in each version of the file.</p>
<p>If &lt;changed file 1&gt; and &lt;changed file 2&gt; have no common ancestor, 
an empty file may be used for &lt;original file&gt;.</p>

Command-line</a> </p>
<H2>ID Clashes and Automatic ID Updates</H2>
<P>When two people are working on a file simultaneously and have overlapping id 
spaces, OBO-Edit may assign the same id to&nbsp;new terms in each person's 
working copy of the ontology. This is known as an id clash, and it is a serious 
problem.</P>
<P>obomerge can detect and resolve id clashes. By default, if id clashes are 
detected obomerge will print a report of detected clashes, then quit.</P>
<P>If <FONT face=Courier>-fail-on-clash NEVER</FONT> or <FONT 
face=Courier>-fail-on-clash IF_LIKELY</FONT> is specified, obomerge will 
continue despite id clashes. If <FONT face=Courier>-update-ids-when 
ALWAYS</FONT> or <FONT face=Courier>-update-ids-when IF_LIKELY</FONT><FONT 
face=Arial> is specified, obomerge will change one of the clashing ids to 
resolve the clash.</FONT></P>
