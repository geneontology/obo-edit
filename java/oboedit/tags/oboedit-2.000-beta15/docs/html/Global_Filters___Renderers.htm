<H1>Global Filters &amp; Renderers</H1>
<P>You may want to apply a filter or renderer to all ontology 
editor panels all the time. OBO-Edit allows you to create <EM>global 
filters</EM> and <EM>global renderers</EM> using the Global Filter Plugin.</P>
<P>Global&nbsp;filters&nbsp;and renderers are applied to every ontology editor panel 
automatically. Global&nbsp;filters and renderers&nbsp;do not appear in 
the&nbsp;ontology editor panel filter menu, and they are not removed by the "Remove 
all&nbsp;renderers and filters" command.</P>
<H2>The Global Filter Plugin</H2>
<P>To&nbsp;edit the&nbsp;global filters, choose&nbsp;The Global Filter Plugin 
from the Plugins menu:</P>
<P><IMG height=342 hspace=0 src="../images/global_filter_filters.gif" width=661 
border=0>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There are two tabs at the top of the plugin. The "Filters" tab contains the 
controls for editing global filter settings. The "Renderers" tab contains 
controls for editing global renderer settings.</P>
<H3>Editing Global Filters</H3>
<P>To edit global filters, click the "Filters" tab. The screenshot above shows 
the "Filter" tab. The filters tab consists of two lists of filters. The "Link 
Filters" list contains all the global link filters, and the "Term filters" list 
contains all the global term filters.</P>
<P>To edit a filter, select it by clicking its name in the list. A filter 
designer will appear where you can edit the filter. The filter designers are 
always locked in "Compound filtering" mode, and it is not possible to change 
between "Link filtering" and "Term filtering".</P>
<P>To add a filter, click the "Add" button under the filter list. A new filter 
will be created that can be edited as described above.</P>
<P>To delete a filter, select the filter to delete and click the "Del" button 
under the filter list.</P>
<H3>Editing Global Renderers</H3>
<P>To edit global renderers, click the "Renderers" tab:</P>
<P><IMG height=342 hspace=0 src="../images/global_filter_renderers.gif" 
width=653 border=0></P>
<P>The renderers tab consists of two lists of renderers. The "Term Renderers" 
list contains all the global term renderers, and the "Link Renderers" list 
contains all the default link renderers.</P>
<P>To edit a renderer, select it by clicking its name in the list. A renderer 
designer will appear where you can edit the renderer. The renderer designers are 
always locked in "Compound filtering" and "Rendering controls" mode, and it is 
not possible to change between "Link filtering" and "Term filtering". Note that 
between the renderer list and the renderer designer, the interface may need a 
lot of space on the screen for all the controls to be visible. Resize the Global 
Renderer Plugin if necessary to see all the controls.</P>
<P>To add a renderer, click the "Add" button under the filter list. A new 
renderer will be created that can be edited as described above.</P>
<P>To delete a renderer, select the renderer to delete and click the "Del" 
button under the renderer list.</P>
<H2>Default Global Filters &amp; Renderers</H2>
<P>When OBO-Edit is first installed, the following global filters and renderers 
are installed by default (note that these default filters and renderers are 
described in terms of their effects. The actual filter definitions tend to be 
more complex than these descriptions):</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Default Term Filters</STRONG>
  <UL>
    <LI>Don't show built-in objects that are not relations (ie 
    obo:datatype)</LI></UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Default Link Filters</STRONG>
  <UL>
    <LI>Don't show links that define an intersection (aka complete 
links)</LI></UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Default Term Renderers</STRONG>
  <UL>
    <LI>Show obsolete terms in red 
    <LI>Show relations in blue</LI></UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Default Link Renderers</STRONG>
  <UL>
    <LI>Show the arrows of rendundant links in red 
    <LI>Show the arrows of implied links in blue</LI></UL></LI></UL>
