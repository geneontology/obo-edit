<H1>Changing Relationship Types</H1>
<div class="tabbed">
<P><STRONG>Works by</STRONG>: Drag-and-drop, right-click, edit menu</P>
<P><STRONG>Hot keys</STRONG>: T</P>
<P><STRONG>Source requirements</STRONG>: One or more source relationships 
allowed for right-click and edit menu, a single source property required for 
drag-and-drop</P>
<P><STRONG>Target requirement</STRONG>: One target required for drag-and-drop, no target required for right-click or edit menu</P>
</div>
<P>Once a relationship has been created between two terms, the relationship type 
(aka property) of the relationship can be changed.</P>
<H2>Using the right-click and edit menus</H2>
<P>Select one or more source relationships to change. 
Choose "Change relationship type" from the right-click menu or edit menu. A list of possible relationship types will appear:</P>
<P><IMG height=91 hspace=0 src="../images/relationship_type_flyout_menu.gif" 
width=349 border=0></P>
<P>Choose a new relationship type from the list. All source relationships will 
be changed to use the new relationship type. Note that some relationship types 
will not be available because of domain and range restrictions, or because the 
selected relationship already uses that type.</P>
<H2>Using drag and drop</H2>
<P>Drag and drop works very differently than the right-click and edit menus when 
changing relationship types. To change a relationship type using drag and drop, 
first select the source <EM>property</EM> you would like to use. Drag the source 
property onto the target relationship you would like to change. A popup menu 
will appear:</P>
<P><IMG height=43 hspace=0 
src="../images/change_relationship_drag_and_drop_popup.gif" width=163 
border=0></P>
<P>Choose "Change relationship type" from the menu (most of 
the time, this will be the only option available). The target relationship will 
be changed to use the source relationship type.</P>
<H3>Using hotkeys</H3>
<P>When dragging, you can hold down the "T" key to specify 
the "Change relationship type" operation. The title above the terms you are dragging will 
change from "Dragging" to "Move...":</P>
<P><IMG height=40 hspace=0 
src="../images/change_relationship_hotkey_drag.gif" width=300 border=0>           
    </P>
<P>           
    When the source relationship type is dropped, the target 
relationship will immediately change to use the new relationship           
    type.</P>
