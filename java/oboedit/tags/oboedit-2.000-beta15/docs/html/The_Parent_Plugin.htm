<P><IMG height=113 hspace=0 src="../images/parent_plugin.gif" width=637

<P>Each line in the display represents a parent link from the currently selected 
term to another term. From left to right, the fields in each line are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Relationship type dropdown</STRONG> - This is a list of all the relationship types in the 
  ontology. The current relationship type for this link is selected. To change 
  the relationship type of this link, choose a new item from the dropdown list. 
  <LI><STRONG>Parent term - </STRONG>This is the id and name of the parent term of this link. Click the id 
  to select the parent term. 
  <LI><STRONG>Intersection checkbox</STRONG> - Whether or not this is an 
  intersection link. Click this checkbox to designate this link as an 
  intersection link. This method of specifying intersection links is 
  <EM>not</EM> 
  recommended. Use the <A href="Cross_Products_in_the_Text_Editor.htm">text 
  editor</A> instead.
  <LI><STRONG>Necessity checkbox</STRONG> - Whether this link is marked 
  "necessary". Links that aren't marked necessary are ignored by the reasoner. 
  Click this checkbox to designate this link as necessary.
  <LI><STRONG>Inverse checkbox</STRONG> - Whether this link is marked "inverse 
  necessary". This means that the inverse of this link is necessarily true. 
  Click this checkbox to designate this link as inverse necessary.
  <LI><STRONG>Cardinality control</STRONG> - Sets the cardinality of this link. 
  This information is not currently used.
  <LI><STRONG>Namespace control</STRONG> - This is a list of all the namespaces 
  in the ontology. This current namespace for this link is selected. To change 
  the namespace of this link, select a new namespace from the dropdown.
  <LI><STRONG>Delete button</STRONG> - Press this button to delete this parent 
  link.</LI></UL>
<P>To add a new parent link, drag the parent term onto the "Drop terms here to 
add new parents" button. A new link will be added with the dropped term as the 
parent, and <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> as the relationship type.</P>
