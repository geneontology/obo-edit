<h1>Introduction to Cross Products</h1>
<p>              
                 
    In the world 
of OBO Ontologies, the phrase "cross product" is a 
little fuzzy. It is often used to mean a&nbsp;simple relationship between 
two terms in different ontologies.</p>
<P>This is <STRONG>not</STRONG> what cross products mean in OBO-Edit!</P>
<P>In OBO-Edit, cross products are a special kind of logical definition called 
an "intersection". An intersection defines one term as equivalent to the 
<EM>intersection</EM> of two or more other terms. (Throughout this guide, the 
terms&nbsp;"cross product" and "intersection" are used interchangeably).</P>
<P>To use a simple, real world example, we might define a "mailman" as an 
intersection of two concepts: "man" and "mail delivery". Our cross product 
definition of a mailman might say "<EM>by definition </EM>a mailman 
<STRONG>is_a</STRONG> 'man' that <STRONG>has_job</STRONG> 'mail delivery'".</P>
<P>Our intersection definition&nbsp;gives the sufficient conditions to determine 
whether another class is a subclass of&nbsp;this class&nbsp;. One of the tasks 
of <A href="The_OBO_Edit_Reasoner.htm">the reasoner</A> is to discover and 
automatically create is_a links implied by cross product definitions.</P>
<P>Continuing our example above, imagine that our ontology also included the 
term 'package delivery man'. 'Package delivery man' has an<STRONG> is_a</STRONG> 
relationship to 'man', and a <STRONG>has_job</STRONG> relationship to 'package 
delivery'. Further, in this ontology, 'package delivery' has an 
<STRONG>is_a</STRONG> relationship to 'mail delivery'.</P>
<P>The reasoner would look at this information and realize that 'package 
delivery man' has an implied&nbsp;<STRONG>is_a</STRONG> relationship to 
'mailman'. Since 'package delivery' is a kind of 'mail delivery', 'package 
delivery man' <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> 'man' that <STRONG>has_job</STRONG> 'mail 
delivery'. Thus, 'package delivery man' <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> 'mailman'. The 
reasoner would go ahead and create that implied link in the ontology.</P>
<P>Intersections are important for any complex ontology, but intersections that 
involve terms from many ontologies are particularly important in the world of 
biological ontologies. Biological ontologies tend to be very 
specialized,&nbsp;describing a specific organism or a specific class of 
concepts. These specialized ontologies often refer to concepts outside their 
limited domain. Cross products are used to&nbsp;give these references precise 
meanings.</P>
<h2>Genus/Differentia</h2>
<p>OBO standards encourage users to use the 
genus/differentia method of defining intersections. Genus/differentia definitions specify the meaning of a 
term by saying "Term X (the term of interest) is 
a subclass of term Y (the genus), differentiated by characteristics A, B, and C 
(the differentia)". In&nbsp;OBO-Edit, a genus/differentia definition&nbsp;will be an 
intersection that&nbsp;contains a single&nbsp;<strong>is_a</strong> relationship 
to a&nbsp;"genus" term, and one or more relationships of some other type to 
"differentia" terms. </p>
<P>Our mailman example above is a genus/differentia definition. A 'mailman' is a 
kind of 'man' differentiated by the fact that he <STRONG>has_job</STRONG> 'mail 
delivery'.</P>
<p>Consider a term like "larval locomotory behavior". A genus/differentia definition of 
"larval locomotory behavior" in OBO format might look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>[Term]<br>id: go_ext:larval_locomotory_behavior<br>name: larval locomotory behavior<br>intersection_of: is_a GO:behavior<br>intersection_of: affects go_ext:locomotion<br>intersection_of: affects go_ext:larva</code></p>
<p>Recall that a cross product defines the sufficient 
conditions for a term to be considered a subclass of another term. For example, 
the cross product definition of "larval locomotory behavior" above could be 
understood to mean "If a term X <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> "behavior" AND 
<STRONG>affects</STRONG> "locomotion" AND <STRONG>affects</STRONG> a "larva" it 
is BY DEFINITION a subclass of "larval locomotory behavior".</p>
