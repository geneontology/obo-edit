<h1>The GO Flat File Adapter</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Reads 
and writes files in the&nbsp;GO Flat File Format (<a 
href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.shtml#goflat">http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.shtml#goflat</a>). 
This is the format originally used by the Gene Ontology Consortium to develop 
the first versions of the GO. <strong><em>Use of this file format is NOT 
recommended!</em></strong> This file format has been officially deprecated 
by the GO Consortium and is included in OBO-Edit only for compatibility with old applications</p>
<p>Even if you need to provide your ontology in GO Flat File format for 
compatibility with an old tool, we suggest you develop and store your ontology 
in OBO 1.2 format and use a tool like <A href="obo2flat.htm">obo2flat</A> to 
automatically generate the GO flat files.</p>
<p><strong>Supported features:</strong> 
This file format supports a very limited subset of OBO-Edit ontology data:            
            
 </p>
<ul>
  <li>Instances 
  <li>Sub-relations - All relations become root level 
  relations and have no relationship to each other. 
  <li>Relation attributes - Domain, range, transitivity, 
  cyclicity, and symmetry information is not saved. 
  <li>Relation meta-data -&nbsp;Relations may only have an 
  id and a name. Relations cannot have definitions, comments, synonyms, 
  dbxrefs, etc. 
  <li>Obsolete terms 
  <li>Intersections (aka cross products) 
  <li>Dbxref descriptions 
  <li>Synonym categories 
  <li>Synonym dbxrefs 
  <li>Synonym scope</li></ul>
<h3>Basic Operation</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;GO Flat File adapter's basic mode conforms to the interface described 
in&nbsp;<A href="The_Basic_Flat_File_Interface.htm">The Basic Flat File 
Interface</A>, with one caveat. The GO Flat File Format stores 
ontology structure in one file, and definitions and comments in another. When loading 
files in basic mode, the paths to all structure files and the 
definitions file are specified together on the file path text field. You may 
specify as many structure files as you like, but you may load only 
one definition file. Ontology files can be loaded from the local disk or from 
a URL.</p>
<p>When saving in basic mode, you may only save a single structure file. 
Definitions and comments will be discarded. To save definitions and comments, 
use advanced mode.</p>
<h3>Advanced Operation</h3>
<h4>Loading</h4>
<p>When the "Advanced" button is pressed, the load dialog changes to look like 
this:</p>
<p><IMG height=483 hspace=0 
src="../images/load_go_advanced.gif" width=579 border=0></p>
<p>This interface allows fine control over the files to be 
loaded. At the top is a list of files to load. To add a new file to load, press 
the "Add" button. A new file with the path "&lt;new file&gt;" will be added.</p>
<p>To delete a file from the list, click the file to select 
it. Then press the "Del" button to remove the file from the list.</p>
<p>To edit a file path, click the file to select it. A path 
editor will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=160 hspace=0 
src="../images/load_go_path_editor.gif" width=526 border=0></p>
<p>To change the path, type a new path into the text box or 
press the "Browse" button to select a file from the disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To specify a definition file, type a path into the 
"Definition file name" text field or click the browse button.</p>
<p>The "Advanced Options" button allows single-character 
symbols to be specified for relations. This is necessary when loading 
<em>very</em> old versions of the GO Flat File Format where the 
file does not contain any information about relations at all. For more 
information about how to do this, see <A href="#property_symbols">Specifying 
Relation Symbols</A>              
            
       below.</p>
<p>The remaining controls are a series of checkboxes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<div><strong>Hide downstream errors</strong> - Often a 
  single error in the file will cause a cascade of syntax errors with this file 
  format. If this box is checked, only the first error will be 
  reported.</div>
  <li>
<div><strong>Allow cycles</strong> - Allows files that 
  contain cycles to be loaded.</div>
  <li>
<div><strong>Allow dangling parent references</strong> - 
  Allows files that contain dangling parents to be loaded.</div>
  <li>
<div><strong>Translate type ids</strong> - Many files in 
  GO Flat File Format use inconsistent ids for common relations. If this box is 
  checked, some common variations of relation ids are converted to the ids used 
  in the OBO Relations specification.</div></li></ul>
<h4>Specifying Relation Symbols<a 
name="property_symbols"></a>  </h4>
<p>Older versions of the GO Flat File Format specification 
use a single character to indicate the type of a link between two terms. When 
loading a very old GO Flat File (or saving for compatibility with very old 
tools), symbol characters must be specified for each relation in the 
ontology.</p>
<p>Realize that it is usually <em>not necessary</em> to specify relation 
symbols. This is only necessary when loading very old files, or when saving with 
the "Use legacy compatible types" option (see below).</p>
<p>To specify relation symbols, click the "Advanced 
Options" button from the load or save dialog. The Relation Symbol editor will 
appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=277 hspace=0 
src="../images/load_go_symbols.gif" width=454 border=0></p>
<p>To the left is a list of relations that have associated 
symbols. To add a new symbol association, press the "Add" button. A new 
association will be added for a type with the id NEWTYPE.</p>
<p>To delete a symbol association, click the association in 
the list to select it. Press the "Del" button to remove the association.</p>
<p>To edit a symbol association, click the association in 
the list to select it. The symbol association editor will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=277 hspace=0 
src="../images/load_go_symbols_editor.gif" width=454 border=0></p>
<p>There are three text editor fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<div><strong>Relationship type symbol</strong> - This is 
  the single character symbol to use for this relation. Each relation must use a 
  different symbol, and the symbol cannot be one of the symbols with special 
  syntactic meaning in the GO Flat File Format (ie exclamation points, 
  semicolons, colons, etc).</div>
  <li>
<div><strong>Relationship type name</strong> - The id of 
  the associated relation</div>
  <li>
<div><strong>Relationship type description</strong> - The 
  name of the associated relation</div></li></ul>
<h4>Saving</h4>
<p>When the "Advanced" button is pressed while saving, the 
save dialog looks like this:</p>
<p><IMG height=381 hspace=0 src="../images/save_go_advanced.gif" width=427 
border=0></p>
<p>The first component is a list of ontology nodes to save. The GO Flat File 
Adapter can save different branches of the ontology to different files. Each 
item in this list associates a branch in the ontology with a save file.</p>
<p>To add an ontology node to the list, press the "Add" button. A new node with 
the location "ROOT" will be added to the list. (See below on how to choose a 
different location than root).</p>
<p>To remove a node from the list, left-click the node to select it, and press 
the "Del" button.</p>
<p>To edit a node, left-click the node to select it. The right side of the 
editor panel will change to an editor that looks like this:</p>
<p><IMG height=77 hspace=0 src="../images/save_go_editor.gif" width=249 
border=0></p>
<p>The top part of the panel indicates which branch to save. To save the entire 
ontology, select "Save at ROOT".</p>
<p>To save a sub-branch, select "Save at". Then, type a branch id into the text 
box, or click the "Browse" button. An ontology browser will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=107 hspace=0 src="../images/save_go_term_browser.gif" width=154 
border=0></p>
<p>Select the branch of the ontology to save by left-clicking, and press ok. The 
id of the selected node will appear in the "Save at" text box.</p>
<p>The "Filename" box contains the file path where the ontology will be saved. A 
path can be typed directly into the box, or a file may be chosen from the disk 
using the "Browse" button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next component in the Advanced save dialog is the definition file path. 
This is the path where the definitions file (containing definitions, definition 
dbxrefs and comments) will be saved. To specify a definition file, type a path 
directly into the text box or use the "Browse" button to select a file from the 
disk. If you would prefer not to create a definition file, this field may be 
left blank, but all your definitions will be lost.</p>
<p>The next set of controls is a series of check boxes:</p>
<UL>
  <li><strong>Allow cycles</strong> - 
  Allows ontologies containing cycles to be saved. Cycles are technically 
  illegal in the GO Flat File Format. If this box is not checked and an attempt 
  is made to save an ontology that contains cycles, the save will fail. 
  <li><strong>Allow dangling parent references</strong> - Allows ontologies containing dangling references to be 
  saved.&nbsp;Dangling references&nbsp;are technically illegal in the GO Flat 
  File Format. If this box is not checked and an attempt is made to save an 
  ontology that contains dangling references, the save will fail. 
  <li><strong>Translate type ids</strong> - If this box is checked, common relationship type ids are 
  translated from the common GO Flat File Format version to standard OBO 
  versions (ie "PARTOF" becomes "part_of"). 
  <li><strong>Reduce file size</strong> - The GO Flat File Format is a highly redundant format. It 
  basically writes out every single path to every single term. Therefore, files 
  grow exponentially larger as more multiple-parentage links are added. The 
  "Reduce file size" option prevents this exponential explosion by only writing 
  a term and its children the first time the term is encountered. This results 
  in much smaller files, although these files may not be compatible with some 
  tools. (However, we've never encountered a tool that cannot load reduced-size 
  files). 
  <li><strong>Use legacy compatible types</strong> - Later versions of the GO Flat File Format moved to a flexible 
  system for writing relationship type ids. However, most tools that read GO 
  flat files do not support this flexible system; instead, they expect 
  relationship types to be represented by a single character. If "Use legacy 
  compatible types" is selected, the GO Flat File Adapter uses the 
  single-character encoding. See <A href="#property_symbols">Specifying Relation 
  Symbols</A>       
               
               
              
             for 
  information on configuring this single-character encoding. </li></UL>
<P>The final component is the "Comment" text field. This is a freetext comment 
that will appear at the top of the saved file.</P>
<P>Press Ok to save.</P>
