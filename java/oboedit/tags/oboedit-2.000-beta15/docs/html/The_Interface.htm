<h1>The Interface</h1>
<p>Most of the time, structural edits to your ontology will 
be accomplished via the ontology editor panel:</p>
<p><IMG height=318 hspace=0 
src="../images/term_editor_panel.gif" width=448 border=0></p>
<p>Some plugins can also make structural changes to the ontology, but most of 
your day-to-day changes will be done here.</p>
<h2>Sources and Targets</h2>
<p>Whenver you make a structural change in the ontology editor panel, that 
structural change operates on some collection of <strong>sources</strong> and 
<strong>targets</strong>. The sources are some collection of relationships 
(usually your current selection) and the target is a single link (often a link 
you've clicked or the final destination of a drag and drop gesture).</p>
<p>Some structural changes are only available with certain sources and targets. 
For example, the <strong>Delete</strong> operation has no target. The 
<strong>Merge</strong> operation is only available when there is a single source 
relationship and a target relationship has been specified. The <strong>Change 
Type</strong>  drag and drop operation only works when there is a single 
source relationship, a target relationship has been defined, AND the child of 
the source relationship is a Property.</p>
<p> Some structural changes may be applied to several sources at once. 
For example, the <strong>Delete</strong> operation allows several relationships 
to be deleted at once. Note that any given editing operation will only be 
available if it can be applied to ALL the currently selected sources. That means 
that if&nbsp;a user selects 30 terms to delete, but one of the terms cannot be 
deleted because it still has children, the <strong>Delete</strong> operation 
will not be available until that undeletable term is no longer selected.</p>

<h2>Three Ways to Edit</h2>
<h3>1) Drag and Drop</h3>
<p>Drag and drop is the simplest, and most often used, editing method in 
OBO-Edit. To use drag and drop, first select the terms you would like to drag. 
This selection will be your <strong>source</strong> relationships. Click and 
drag your selection.&nbsp;A drag graphic will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=257 hspace=0 src="../images/dragging.gif" width=419 border=0></p>
<p>Drag the <strong>sources&nbsp;</strong>over&nbsp;your desired 
<strong>target</strong> relationship.&nbsp;When 
the&nbsp;<strong>sources</strong> are above a potential 
<strong>target</strong>,&nbsp;a yellow box will appear around the 
<strong>target</strong>:</p>
<p><IMG height=126 hspace=0 src="../images/drag_highlight.gif" width=395 
border=0></p>
<p>&nbsp;When the mouse button is released, the sources will be dropped, and 
a&nbsp;menu of possible editing options will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=131 hspace=0 src="../images/drop_menu.gif" width=355 
border=0></p>
<p>The menu of editing options will only contain options that make sense given 
the <strong>sources</strong> you dragged and the <strong>target</strong> you 
dropped onto.</p>
<p>To cancel a drag and drop operation in mid-drag, drop 
the sources onto an empty part of the screen (make sure no target is highlighted). To dismiss the drag and drop popup 
menu, click somewhere on the screen other than the menu (on some platforms, the 
drag and drop menu is automatically dismissed when the mouse is moved off of 
the menu).</p>
<p>Note that some drag and drop operations have keyboard shortcuts that allow 
you to specify the edit operation as you're dragging. This allows you to edit 
faster, without having to see additional popup menus when you drop your 
selection. See the details for individual editing operations to learn the 
keyboard shortcuts for each one.</p>
<p>Not all editing operations are available via drag-and-drop (for example, 
adding new terms and deleting terms can only be achieved via menu-based editing 
methods - see below).</p>
<h3>2) Right-Click Menu</h3>
<p>Editing operations can also be done by bringing up a right-click menu. The 
right-click menu is displayed by right-clicking (or command-clicking on MacOS) 
the mouse.</p>
<p>The currently selected relationships are used as the <strong>sources</strong> 
for the editing operation. If you right-click a certain term, that term is used 
as the <strong>target</strong> for the editing operation.</p>
<p> The right-click menu will display all the 
currently available editing operations. If an operation cannot be performed on the 
current target or sources, the operation will be grayed-out. The right-click menu contains more than just 
editing operations; the right-click menu also allows you to configure display options 
for the current ontology editor panel.</p>
<h3>3) Edit Menu</h3>
<p>The edit menu is available on the main OBO-Edit menu bar:</p>
<p><IMG height=411 hspace=0 src="../images/edit_menu.gif" 
width=218 border=0></p>
<p>When using the edit menu, the currently selected 
relationships are used as the <strong>sources</strong>. It 
is not possible to select a <STRONG>target</STRONG> with the edit menu. As a result, all operations that require a target will 
be grayed-out on the edit menu.</p>
