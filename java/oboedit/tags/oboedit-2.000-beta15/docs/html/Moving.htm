<h1>Moving</h1>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by:</strong> Drag and drop, right-click</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: X</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements:</strong> One or more source relationships required</p>
<P><STRONG>Target requirement</STRONG>: One target required</P>
</div>
<p>The move operation removes a parent relationship from a 
term, and creates a new relationship with a different parent. The move operation 
is analagous to an of "<A href="Adding_New_Relationships.htm">Add Child</A>" operation and a "<A 
href="Deleting.htm">Delete</A>" operation from 
the original parent.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;move one or more relationships, select a collection of source 
relationships that you would like to move. Then, select a target term to which 
they will be&nbsp;moved by right-clicking the target term or by 
drag-and-drop.</p>
<p>The move&nbsp;menu item has a flyout submenu of the relationship type that 
should be used when creating the new relationships:</p>
<p><IMG height=168 hspace=0 src="../images/move_menu_flyout.gif" width=318 
border=0></p>
<p>Select the relationship type you would like for the new relationship, and it 
will be created. If you would like the new relationship to use the same 
relationship type as the original source relationship, use the "Use original 
type" menu option. This is particularly useful if you are creating several 
relationships at once by using a number of source relationships. If "Use 
original type" is used with untyped source relationships (ie one or more of your 
sources is an ontology root) the is_a relationship is used. </p>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>    
               
             
           
             
            
              
   
<p>When dragging, you can use the X key to specify the 
"Move" operation. The title above the terms you are dragging will change from 
"Dragging" to "Move...":</p>
<p><IMG height=52 hspace=0 src="../images/move_hotkey_drag.gif" width=102 
border=0></p>
<p>When the term is dropped, the type selection menu will 
pop up.</p>
<p>If you are holding down the "X" keys while dragging, you can hold down the 
"Shift" key to indicate that you wish to use the "Use original type" option when 
assigning relationship types for the newly created relationships. The phrase 
"Move (original type)" will appear in the title bar above the dragged terms. 
When the terms are dropped, no menus will appear at all; the new parents or 
children will be added immediately.</p>
