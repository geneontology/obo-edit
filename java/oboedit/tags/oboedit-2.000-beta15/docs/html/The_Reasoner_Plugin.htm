<h1>The Reasoner Plugin</h1>
<p>The reasoner is activated and deactivated via the 
reasoner plugin. If the reasoner is inactive, the plugin looks like this:</p>
<p><IMG height=106 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_plugin.gif" width=192 
border=0></p>
<p>To activate the reasoner, click the "Use reasoner" button.</p>
<p>When this button is pressed, the reasoner starts up and begins reasoning. The 
progress bar may fill up several times before reasoning is complete; there is no 
way to predict in advance how many reasoner passes will be necessary to reason 
over an ontology, so the progress bar simply shows the progress of the current 
reasoner pass.</p>
<p>Once reasoning is complete, a status message appears:</p>
<p><IMG height=174 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_plugin_status.gif" width=346 
border=0></p>
<p>The first line gives the number of milliseconds elapsed during reasoning.</p>
<p>The second line shows how many implied links were discovered.</p>
<p>The third line shows how many implied links are actually <em>shown</em>. Most implied links are trimmed (see <A 
href="The_Reasoner_and_the_Interface.htm#trimming">trimming</A>). This line 
shows how many implied links were <em>not</em>  
    trimmed. </p>
<p>The final line shows how many redundant links were found in the ontology.</p>
<p>To turn off the reasoner, unclick the "Use reasoner" box.</p>

<h1>Wait... Did I Leave the Reasoner On?</h1>
<hr>

<p>     Like any other 
plugin, the reasoner plugin remembers its state when OBO-Edit is exited. This 
means that if the reasoner is on when you exit OBO-Edit, 
it will be on the next time you start OBO-Edit. </p>
<p>This entire application runs more slowly when the reasoner is running, so 
enable it with caution.</p></div>
