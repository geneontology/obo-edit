<H1>Text Checks</H1>
<P>Comment checks, definition checks, name checks and 
synonym checks are all very similar, so they are all discussed in this 
section.</P>
<P>A text check looks for the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Repeated words</STRONG> 
  - A warning will appear if the text contains a repeated word. Of course, some 
  words should be repeated, so OBO-Edit maintains a list of legally repeatable 
  words. Use the appropriate <A 
  href="The_Verification_Plugin.htm#quickfix">quick fix</A> to add a word to the 
  list of allowed repeats.
  <LI><STRONG>Repeated whitespace</STRONG> - A warning will appear if multiple 
  whitespace character (like spaces or tabs) appear in a row.
  <LI><STRONG>Sentence case</STRONG> - A warning will appear if a new sentence 
  starts with a lower-case letter. Sometimes sentences should start with a lower 
  case letter, so OBO-Edit provides a <A 
  href="The_Verification_Plugin.htm#quickfix">quick fix</A> that allows a word 
  to be added to a list of words that may legally appear at the beginning of a 
  sentence in lower case.
  <LI><STRONG>Sentence punctuation</STRONG> (definitions and comments only) - A 
  warning will appear if a definition or comment doesn't end with appropriate 
  punctuation.
  <LI><STRONG>Sentence separation</STRONG> - A warning will appear if a period, 
  question mark or exclamation point is not followed by a space. Sometimes a 
  period should not be followed by a space (for example, in an abbreviation), so 
  OBO-Edit provides a quick fix that adds a word to a list of legal 
  abbreviations. OBO-Edit knows the abbreviations "i.e.", "e.g." and "etc." by 
  default.</LI></UL>
<P>A text check can be configured by clicking the "Configure" button in the 
Verification Plugin:</P>
<P><IMG height=199 hspace=0 
src="../images/verification_plugin_textedit_config.gif" width=263 border=0></P>
<P>Each line of the configuration window configures one of the checks listed 
above. Each check can be configured to run under one of the following 
conditions:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>On Text Edit</STRONG> - This 
  part of the text&nbsp;check will only be run before committing a text edit 
  <LI><STRONG>Always</STRONG> - This part 
  of the text check will always be run. 
  <LI><STRONG>Never</STRONG> - This part of the text check will never be 
  run.</LI></UL>
<P>The default setting for all checks is <STRONG>Always</STRONG>.</P>
