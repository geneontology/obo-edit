<h1>The History Plugin</h1>
<p>The History Plugin is accessed via the "Plugins" menu. 
It looks like this:</p>
<p><IMG height=161 hspace=0 src="../images/history_plugin.gif" width=206 
border=0></p>
<p>The main panel displays a hierarchy of the available 
history information. Usually, there will only be one history list visible: 
"Current session". Some data adapters may be able to show history lists from 
past saves, but none of the built-in 
OBO-Edit adapters can do this at present.</p>
<p>Each history list may contain&nbsp;a number of history items. The "Current 
session" history list will contain the list of edits that have been made since 
the current ontology was loaded. To see the edits under a history list, click 
the expansion control to the left of the history list:</p>
<p><IMG height=142 hspace=0 src="../images/history_plugin_expanded1.gif" 
width=310 border=0></p>
<p>Each item directly under the history list represents a user-initiated edit. 
Note that each edit above ends with the text "(macro)". This means that these 
user-initiated edits are complex "macro" edits composed of a number of simpler 
edits. A "macro" edit can be expanded to show the simple edits of which it is 
composed:</p>
<p><IMG height=200 hspace=0 src="../images/history_plugin_expanded2.gif" 
width=405 border=0></p>
<p>To see details on any edit, left-click the edit to select it. A text box will 
appear below containing detailed information about the edit:</p>
<p><IMG height=300 hspace=0 src="../images/history_plugin_edit_details.gif" 
width=347 border=0></p>
<p>Sometimes the detailed information panel will contain a term id displayed as 
an underlined hyperlink. Click the hyperlink to select the term with that 
id.</p>
<p>Special details are visible when the history list node is selected:</p>
<p><IMG height=321 hspace=0 src="../images/history_plugin_session_deta.gif" 
width=317 border=0></p>
<p>The top of the detail panel shows who created this initial history list and 
when it was created (this information usually comes from the "saved-by" and 
"date" tags in an <A href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm">OBO</A> file 
header).</p>
<p>The center of the panel shows any ontology comments that were loaded with the 
current ontology. These comments can be modified and saved by clicking the "Save 
History" button.</p>
