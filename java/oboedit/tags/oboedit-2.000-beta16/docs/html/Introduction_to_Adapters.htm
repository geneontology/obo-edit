<H1>Introduction to Adapters</H1>
<P>OBO-Edit loads and saves data through the use of 
<STRONG>data adapters.</STRONG> Data adapters are little code modules that know 
how to get data into or out of OBO-Edit. A data adapter may read data from a 
formatted file on a hard drive, write data to a relational database, or download 
a file from CVS.</P>
<P>Every file format/database schema/whatever is different. Many data adapters 
have complex options, particularly when saving data. This section provides a 
general overview of how to load and save, and then an in-depth discussion of 
each of OBO-Edit's built-in data adapters.</P>
