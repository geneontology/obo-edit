<h1>The Ontology Editor Panel</h1>
<p>Once an ontology is loaded, there are a number of ways to view it. The ontology editor panel is the main view 
of the classes in your ontology.</p>
<p><IMG height=318 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel.gif" width=448 
border=0></p>
<h2>Top Level Nodes</h2>
<p>Whenever OBO-Edit loads an ontology, the ontology editor panel always contains 
three root nodes named "Classes", "Relations", and "Obsolete":</p>
<p><IMG height=318 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_roots.gif" 
width=448 border=0></p>
<p>All of the classes (aka "terms") in your ontology are listed beneath the 
"Classes" nodes. Relations (aka relationship types) are listed beneath 
"Relations", and all obsolete objects (which may be classes, relations, or 
instances) will be listed under the Obsolete node.</p>
<p>These top level nodes <strong>do not represent objects in the 
ontology</strong>. They exist simply to help organize the display. You cannot 
select these top-level nodes or modify them in any way.</p>

<h2>Expanding/Collapsing Nodes</h2>
<p>The ontology editor panel displays the ontology as a tree. Branches of the tree 
can be expanded or collapsed, so that only a part of the tree is visible at any 
one time. The expand/collapse controls look like boxes containing a plus or 
minus sign:</p>
<p><IMG height=318 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_collapse.gif" 
width=448 border=0></p>
<p>If expand/collapse control is marked with a plus, that means that there are 
other branches of the tree below, and clicking on the control will cause those 
branches to become visible. If the control is marked with a minus, it means that 
child branches are already visible, and clicking on the control will cause them 
to be collapsed. If a line in the display has no expand/collapse control (like 
"cellular component unknown" in the image above), it means that there are no 
branches beneath that node.</p>

<h2>Representing Relationships</h2>
<p>The ontology editor panel displays the ontology as a tree, with "child" nodes 
appearing beneath their "parent" nodes. Each node in the display represents a 
relationship between two terms. Consider this small piece of the display:</p>
<p><IMG height=24 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_link.gif" width=181 
border=0></p>
<p>Here, "extracellular organelle" is beneath "organelle" and is indented to the 
right. This indicates that "extracellular organelle" is a <em>child</em> of 
organelle.</p>
<p>Each line of the display describes a relationship between a child term and 
its parents. The arrow is there as a reminder that these relationships are to be 
read from <strong>right-to-left</strong>. The <IMG height=12 hspace=0 
src="../images/is_a.gif" width=13 border=0>&nbsp;symbol means that the 
relationship type is <strong>is_a</strong>, so the example above means:</p><pre>extracellular organelle <strong>is_a</strong> organelle</pre>
<p>We understand the relationships the same way if a node has multiple 
children:</p>
<p><IMG height=318 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_links.gif" 
width=448 border=0></p>
<p>The highlighed section means:</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier">extracellular organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">intracellular organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">membrane-bound organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">non-membrance-bound organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">organelle lumen <strong>part_of</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">organelle <strong>is_a</strong> cellular 
  component</font></li></ul>
<h2>Relationship Types</h2>
<p>Relationship types are represented as icons that appear between a parent and 
child term:</p>
<p><IMG height=318 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_types.gif" 
width=448 border=0></p>
<p>A few icons for common relationship types are provided by 
OBO-Edit by default. (See <A href="The_Configuration_Plugin.htm">The 
Configuration Plugin</A> for information on customizing these icons.)</p>
<p>Note that root classes, root relations, and obsolete terms do not have a 
relationship type where the connect to the root display nodes. For example, 
there is no relationship type icon between "biological process" and "Classes" in 
the above example. That is because relationship types only exist between 
entities in the ontology. Since the top level nodes are simply to organize the 
display, entities in the ontology have no named relationship to them.</p>
<h2>Viewing Obsoletes</h2>
<p>Obsolete terms appear under the "Obsolete" node. 
Although obsolete terms cannot have parents or children,&nbsp;if an obsolete 
term has replacement or "consider" terms specified, they will appear underneath the 
obsolete term:</p>
<p><IMG height=79 hspace=0 
src="../images/obsolete_replacement_view.gif" width=332 border=0>            
 </p>
<p>In this case, the view means that the obsolete term 
"2-nitropropane biosynthesis" has been replaced by "2-nitroproppane metabolism". 
The obsolete "26S proteasome" does not have an exact replacement, but the, 
depending on context, one of the terms "proteasome complex (sensu Eukaryota)", 
"proteasome core complex (sensu Bacteria)" and "proteasome regulatory particle (sensu Bacteria)" might be a 
valid replacement.</p>
<p>Note that "replaced by" and "consider" <em>are not real 
relationship types.</em> There is no relation named "replaced by" or "consider". 
These lines appear in the ontology editor panel as a viewing convenience, but they 
do not represent real relationships in the ontology. They merely represent assignments to the OBO&nbsp;tags named&nbsp;"consider" 
and "replaced-by".</p>
<p>See <A href="Assigning_Replacement_Terms.htm">Assigning Replacement Terms</A> 
for more information about "consider" and "replaced-by".</p>
<h2>Working with Multiple ontology editor panels</h2>
<p>There can be several ontology editor panels on screen at once (to learn how to 
add more ontology editor panels to your interface, see the "Display Controls" 
section below and the <A href="Customizing_the_Interface.htm">Customizing the 
Interface</A> section).</p>
<p>If there is more than one ontology editor panel, each panel's display is entirely 
independent. Each panel may display a different section of the ontology, may be 
filtered differently, may have different rendering settings, and may have a 
different collection of terms selected (kind of - see <A 
href="Working_with_Selections.htm">Working with Selections</A> for a 
clarification).</p>
<p>However, no matter how many ontology editor panels are on screen, each is 
displaying a different view <em>of the <strong>same</strong> ontology</em>. 
Edits that are executed on one ontology editor panel will affect the contents of 
<strong>all</strong> ontology editor panels.</p>
<h2><A name=display_controls></A>Display Controls</h2>
<p>There are a number of buttons at the bottom of each ontology editor panel:</p>
<ul>
  <li><IMG height=17 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_corner.gif" 
  width=17 border=0>&nbsp;This button is 
  used to hide the button panel that contains the rest of the ontology editor panel 
  buttons. If the button panel is hidden, this button contains a + icon. 
  <li><IMG height=20 hspace=0 
  src="../images/term_editor_panel_primary_button.gif" width=20 
  border=0>&nbsp;This button indicates whether the current ontology editor panel is 
  the <em>primary selection panel </em>(see <A 
  href="Working_with_Selections.htm">Working with Selections</A>). If 
  the current panel is primary, the circle icon will be green. If it is not, the 
  circle icon will be blue. Clicking this button will make this panel the 
  primary panel. If this panel is already the primary panel, pressing this 
  button will select another panel.
  <LI><IMG height=20 hspace=0 
  src="../images/term_editor_panel_left_button.gif" width=20 border=0>&nbsp;This 
  button is used to change the current sub-selection (see <A 
  href="Working_with_Selections.htm">Working with Selections</A>  
                  
    ). If more than one term is selected in the ontology 
  editor panel, this button will step backward through the currently selected terms 
  to pick a new sub-selection.
  <LI><IMG height=20 hspace=0 
  src="../images/term_editor_panel_right_button.gif" width=20 
  border=0>&nbsp;This button is used to change the current sub-selection (see <A 
  href="Working_with_Selections.htm">Working with Selections</A>). If 
  more than one term is selected in the ontology editor panel, this button will 
  step forward through the currently selected terms to pick a new sub-selection.  
                 
                  
                  
    
  <li><IMG height=20 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_horz_split.gif" 
  width=20 border=0>&nbsp;This button 
  splits the current ontology editor panel horizontally to create two ontology 
  editor panels. A ontology editor panel may be split any number of 
  times. 
  <li><IMG height=20 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_vert_split.gif" 
  width=20 border=0>&nbsp;This button 
  splits the current ontology editor panel vertically to create two ontology 
  editor panels. A ontology editor panel may be split any number of 
  times. 
  <li><IMG height=20 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_merge_button.gif" 
  width=20 border=0>&nbsp;If the 
  current ontology editor panel was created by splitting an existing ontology editor 
  panel, this button will merge the two panels. Two panels can also be merged by 
  right-clicking the divider between two panels. 
  <li><IMG height=20 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_lock_button.gif" 
  width=20 border=0>&nbsp;This button 
  locks the scrollbars of the current ontology editor panel. When a ontology editor 
  panel is locked, it is still possible to edit terms, make new selections, 
  expand/collapse nodes, etc, but it becomes impossible to scroll the window. 
  <li><IMG height=20 hspace=0 
  src="../images/term_editor_panel_refresh_button.gif" width=20 
  border=0>&nbsp;This 
  button forces the ontology editor panel to refresh the screen. This can be useful 
  if the view becomes corrupted due to a bug or out of memory condition. 
  <li><IMG height=20 hspace=0 
  src="../images/term_editor_panel_filter_button.gif" width=20 
  border=0>&nbsp;This 
  button pops up the filter management menu. This menu allows you to remove the 
  current filter and remove some or all of the current renderers on this ontology 
  editor panel. See <A href="Filtering.htm">Filtering</A> and <A 
  href="Rendering.htm">Rendering</A> for more 
  information.
  <li><IMG height=20 hspace=0 
  src="../images/term_editor_panel_prefilter_button.gif" width=20 
  border=0>&nbsp;This button displays a popup menu containing all the available 
  properties in the ontology.&nbsp;Select a property from the menu to specify a 
  <A href="Reasoner_Prefilters.htm">prefilter property</A> for the editor panel. 
  This button&nbsp;is only enabled when the reasoner is active.   
   
  <li><IMG height=20 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_root_button.gif" 
  width=20 border=0>&nbsp;<a 
  name=root_algorithm></a>This button allows you to choose the <em>root 
  picking algorithm</em>. 
  Two methods are available: 
  <ul>
    <li> GREEDY - This algorithm treats any class or 
    relation with no <em>available</em> parents as a root 
    term. If a term has been orphaned because a filter has hidden its parents 
    (see <A href="Filtering.htm#root_picking">Orphaned Terms and the Root 
    Picking Algorithm</A>), the term will appear as a root term 
    using this algorithm.
    <li> STRICT - This algorithm treats any class or 
    relation with no <em>defined</em> parents as a root 
    term. If a term has been orphaned because a filter has hidden its parents 
    (see <A href="Filtering.htm#root_picking">Orphaned Terms and the Root 
    Picking Algorithm</A>), this algorithm will <em>not</em> treat 
    the term as a root. The term simply will not be visible until the filter is removed. </li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Note that many of these display options can also be modified via the ontology 
editor panel right-click menu. Right-click (or command-click on MacOS) within 
the ontology editor panel to bring up the right-click menu.</p>
