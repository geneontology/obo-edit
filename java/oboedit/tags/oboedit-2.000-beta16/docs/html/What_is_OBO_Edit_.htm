<h1>What is OBO-Edit?</h1>
<p>OBO-Edit is an open source, platform-independent application for viewing and editing OBO ontologies.</p>
<p>OBO-Edit is a graph-based tool; its emphasis on the overall graph structure 
of an ontology provides a friendly interface for biologists, and makes 
OBO-Edit excellent for the rapid generation of large ontologies focusing on 
relationships between relatively simple classes.</p>
<h2>A Brief History of OBO-Edit</h2>
<p>    OBO-Edit began life as GO-Edit, a tool designed 
exclusively for use in editing the Gene Ontology. As more and more projects began 
to adopt the Gene Ontology standards for ontologies, GO-Edit became 
more flexible to accommodate the needs of more diverse ontologies. Eventually, GO-Edit 
became so general that it was renamed DAG-Edit, because DAG-Edit "ontologies" were a 
special sort of Directed Acyclic Graph.</p>
<p>DAG-Edit was a useful, fairly configurable tool. However, the 
code&nbsp;carried a lot of baggage from its former life as GO-Edit. And at its 
heart, DAG-Edit was really a program for editing labeled, directed graphs, not 
an ontology editor. DAG-Edit users began to have more and more complex needs for 
their ontologies. The Open Biological Ontologies project developed a new, much 
more expressive file format for describing ontologies. It was time for DAG-Edit 
to undergo another transformation.</p>
<p>So DAG-Edit became OBO-Edit, hopefully to be renamed for the last time. 
OBO-Edit has been (almost) completely recoded from the ground up. OBO-Edit is 
faster, more memory efficient, and more fully featured than its ancestors. 
OBO-Edit is a complete (if simple) ontology editor, with full support for the 
OBO ontology format.</p>
<p>Neat, huh?</p>
