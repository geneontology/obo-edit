<H1>Reusing Filters</H1>
<P>You may find yourself using a particular filter again 
and again. If it's a compound filter with lots of pieces, it's annoying to have 
to recreate the filter every time you need to use it.</P>
<P>Luckily, it's possible to save your filters and reuse them later.</P>
<P>In most places where you work with filters, you will see three buttons that 
look like this:</P>
<P><IMG height=20 hspace=0 src="../images/filter_load_save_buttons.gif" width=83 
border=0></P>
<P>The first button is the "new filter" button. Clicking this button will wipe 
out the current contents of the filter editor and replace them with a brand new 
filter.</P>
<P>The second button is the "load filter" button. Clicking this button will 
bring up a window where you can choose a saved filter file from the disk. The 
filter will be read from the file and loaded into the filter editor.</P>
<P>The third button is the "save filter" button. Clicking this button will bring 
up a window where you can specify a file name for the saved filter file. The 
current filter will be saved onto the disk in the file you 
specify.</P>
