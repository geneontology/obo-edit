<P>Once a term is obsolete, most of its attributes cannot be 
edited. Obsolete terms cannot have relationships to other terms, and most text 
attributes of obsolete terms cannot be modified.</P>
<P>However, it is possible to edit the definition and comments of an obsolete 
term. To edit an obsolete term, select it and follow the editing instructions 
described in the <A href="Text_Editing.htm">Text Editing</A> section of this 
guide. Editing controls for uneditable attributes will be 
disabled.</P>
