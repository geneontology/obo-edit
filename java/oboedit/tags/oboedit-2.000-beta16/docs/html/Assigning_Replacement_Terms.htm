<h1>Assigning Replacement Terms</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most terms are obsoleted because they represent a flawed 
concept. Usually, the flawed concept is replaced with another concept that more 
accurately represents the needs of the ontology. OBO-Edit allows users to 
specify replacements for obsolete terms. These replacements can be used by human 
annotators as a useful reference, or can be used by software to automatically 
re-assign database entities that were associated with a term that became 
obsolete.</p>
<h2>Specifying a Replacement Term</h2>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by</strong>: drag and 
drop</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: none</p>
<p><strong>Target required?</strong>: yes</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: a single source term required</p>
</div>
<p>If an obsolete term is perfectly supplanted by another term, the new term may 
be specified as a <em>replacement</em> term. Note that a replacement term should 
only be specified if the obsolete term can be replaced by <em>exactly this term 
in every case</em>. If this criterion is not met, use a "consider" term 
instead.</p>
<p>Replacement terms should be specified when possible, because replacement 
terms can be used by software agents to do automatic corrections in databases 
when a term becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>To specify a replacement for an obsolete term, select a source term to act as 
the replacement. Drag the replacement source onto the target obsolete term. When 
the term is dropped, a menu will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=39 hspace=0 src="../images/replacement_drop_menu.gif" width=119 
border=0></p>
<p>Choose "Set replacement" from the menu to assign the replacement term.</p>
<h2>Specifying a Term to Consider</h2>
<p><strong>Gesture types:</strong> drag and drop</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: none</p>
<p><strong>Target required?:</strong> yes</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements:</strong> one or more source terms required</p>
<p>Often, there is not a single obvious replacement term for an obsolete term. 
Usually there are several possible replacements, and the correct replacement 
depends on context. In these cases, a user may specify one or more "consider" 
terms that a human expert would look at.</p>
<p>To specify a "consider" term for an obsolete term, select&nbsp;one or 
more&nbsp;source terms to consider. Drag the&nbsp;"consider" source onto the 
target obsolete term. When the terms&nbsp;are dropped, a menu will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=39 hspace=0 src="../images/replacement_drop_menu.gif" width=119 
border=0></p>
<p>Choose "Add consider term" from the menu to assign the replacement terms.</p>
<h2>Removing Replacement/Consider Terms</h2>
<p><strong>Gesture types</strong>: right-click menu, edit menu</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: none</p>
<p><strong>Target required?:</strong> no</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: one or more source terms required</p>
<p>To remove a replacement or consider term, select the consider or replacement 
term to remove <em>underneath the obsolete term to which it is assigned</em>. 
That is, make sure that you have selected the term to remove in the context 
where it is preceded by the label "replaced by" or "consider":</p>
<p><IMG height=79 hspace=0 src="../images/obsolete_replacement_view.gif" 
width=332 border=0></p>
<p>From the right-click or edit menu, choose either "Remove consider term" or 
"Remove replacement term".</p>
