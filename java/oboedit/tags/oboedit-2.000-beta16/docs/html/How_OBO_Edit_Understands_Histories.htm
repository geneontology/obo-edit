<H1>How OBO-Edit Understands Histories</H1>
<P>Every time a user changes any part of an ontology, the user-interface creates a 
<STRONG>history object</STRONG> 
that represents the change. The history object is then sent to the 
<STRONG>operation model</STRONG>, which uses the history object to actually make 
changes to the ontology. The operation model can use a history object to change 
the ontology, or it can use a history object to undo changes to the ontology. </P>
<P>Every ontology change is mediated by history objects. After a history object 
is applied to the ontology, the objects are stored in a list called the 
<STRONG>history list</STRONG>. The history&nbsp;list makes <A 
href="Undo_Redo.htm">Undo/Redo</A> possible; when a user requests an undo, the 
most recently added item is pulled off the history list and sent to the 
operation model to be reversed.</P>
<P>The current history list can be viewed using <A 
href="The_History_Plugin.htm">The History Plugin</A>. It is possible to <A 
href="Saving_a_History_File.htm">save the history list</A> to a file, or to <A 
href="Loading_a_History_File.htm">load a history list</A> from a file so that 
the edits are applied to the currently loaded ontology (this can be used to 
merge edits from two users who are working on the same ontology simultaneously). 
It is also possible to automatically examine two versions of an ontology and <A 
href="The_Change_Tracker_Plugin.htm">reconstruct the history list</A> that would 
be necessary to change one version of the ontology to the 
other.</P>
