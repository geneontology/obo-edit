<h1>The Configuration Plugin</h1>
<p>The Configuration Plugin contains all the configuration 
options in OBO-Edit. Open the Configuration Plugin by selecting it from the 
"Plugins" menu:</p>
<p><IMG height=510 hspace=0 
src="../images/config_plugin_gui.gif" width=608 border=0></p>
<p>The "Save Configuration" button accepts any changes and 
updates the display. There are several tabs of configuration info. The first tab is "General 
GUI".</p>
<h2>General GUI Options</h2>
<h3>Relationship Type Icons</h3>
<p>These controls allow a custom icon to be specified for a relationship type. 
<em>This does not create new relationship types!</em> It just associates an icon 
with a relationship type.</p>
<p>Note that relationship types don't need a custom icon. If no icon is specified, OBO-Edit will display the default icon, consisting of a black rectangle containing the relationship type id in black text.</p>
<p>To edit an existing relationship type icon association, left-click the 
association to edit it. The icon association editor will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=107 hspace=0 src="../images/config_plugin_icons.gif" width=246 
border=0></p>
<p>Enter the id of the relationship type to associate into the "Relationship 
type" box. Type a file location or URL for an image file to use as an icon into 
the "Icon URL" box. To pick an image file from the local disk, press the "Browse 
files" button. To use one of OBO-Edit's built-in icons, press the "Browse 
built-in icons" button.</p>
<p>To delete a relationship type icon association, left-click the association 
and press the "Del" button.</p>
<p>To add a new relationship type icon association, press the "Add" button. A 
new association will be created with the id "UNKNOWN" and the icon path "&lt;new 
icon path&gt;".</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h1>Why won't my is_a icon appear?</h1>
<hr>
<p class="sidebar">Longtime users of OBO-Edit or DAG-Edit may find that OBO-Edit seems to ignore their settings for the <b>is_a</b> icon, but all other icons seem to display correctly. Remember, the id for <b>is_a</b> has changed 
recently to ensure compatibility with <a 
href="http://obo.sourceforge.net/relationship/">the OBO relations ontology</a>. 
The new id for <strong>is_a</strong> is <strong>OBO_REL:is_a</strong>           .</p>
</div>


<h3>Runtime display options</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Case sensitive term sorting</strong> - If this box is checked, the case of a term name will be 
  taken into account when sorting terms. Lower case letters will appear before 
  upper case letters. 
  <li><strong>Show terms ids as tool tips in term panels</strong> - If this box 
  is checked, the id of a term will appear if the mouse hovers over a term in 
  the <A href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">ontology editor panel</a>               
    . Enabling this feature will make OBO-Edit run slightly slower 
  on older machines. 
  <li><strong>Confirm on exit</strong>- If this 
  box is checked, OBO-Edit will ask for confirmation before exiting.</li></ul>
<h3>Startup Options</h3>
<p>These are options that do not take effect until OBO-Edit is restarted.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>OBO-Edit memory allocation</strong> - The text box specifies the amount of memory that should 
  be allocated to OBO-Edit. The value is given as an integer followed by the 
  letter M, indicating the number of megabytes of memory that should be 
  allocated. A high value will prevent OBO-Edit from running out of memory and 
  crashing, but higher values will lessen the amount of memory available to 
  other programs and may cause OBO-Edit to run slower on some platforms. 
  <li><strong>Default font</strong> - These controls specify the font OBO-Edit 
  should use when displaying buttons, labels, dropdown menus, etc. The first 
  dropdown specifies the font family name, the second specifies the font size, 
  and the third specifies the font style (normal, italic, bold or bold-italic). 
  The "Font preview" label below will display the example text in the selected 
  font.</li></ul>
<h2>Paths &amp; Autosave</h2>
<p><IMG height=510 hspace=0 
src="../images/config_plugin_paths.gif" width=608 border=0></p>
<h3>Paths</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Config file</strong> - 
  Displays the path to the ".oboedit" directory that contains all of OBO-Edit's 
  configuration info. This field is not editable; it provides information alone. 

  <li><strong>History file</strong> - The location of the history configuration 
  file that contains data adapter configuration info, including save profiles. 
  This location can be changed if the user wishes.</li></ul>
<h3>Autosave Options</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enable autosave</strong> - If this box is checked, autosave will 
  be enabled. The ontology will be saved periodically in <A 
  href="The_Serial_Adapter.htm">serial format</a>. 
  <li><strong>Autosave file path</strong> -&nbsp;This&nbsp;field specifies&nbsp;a directory where autosave 
  files will be stored. 
  <li><strong>Do autosave every</strong> - This field specifies the number of minutes between autosaves 
  <li><strong>Autosave files expire in </strong>- The number of days old an 
  autosave file must be before it is automatically deleted.</li></ul>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p><IMG height=85 hspace=0 src="../images/config_plugin_behavior.gif" width=232 
border=0></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Allow new cycles to be created</strong> - If this box is checked, OBO-Edit will allow cycles to be 
  created. If it is not checked, OBO-Edit will refuse to allow new cycles to be 
  made. Only enable this option if an ontology requires cycles. Most do not. See 
  <A href="Text_Editing.htm#is_cyclic">cyclic relations</a>                
                 
       &nbsp;&nbsp;for more information about what constitutes a cycle.&nbsp; 
  <li><strong>Warn before final delete</strong> - If this box is checked, OBO-Edit displays a warning before 
  the last instance of a term is deleted and the term becomes obsolete. 
  <li><strong>Warn before discarding definitions on save</strong> - If this box 
  is checked, the old <A href="The_GO_Flat_File_Adapter.htm">GO Flat File 
  Adapter</a> will 
  issue a warning when saving with no definition file. 
  <li><strong>Use advanced root detection</strong> - If this box is selected, 
  OBO-Edit will use advanced root detection. Normally, OBO-Edit treats a term as 
  a root if it has no parents. If advanced root detection is enabled, terms with 
  no <em>transitive</em> parents are treated as roots.</li></ul>
<h2>User Settings</h2>
<p><IMG height=510 hspace=0 
src="../images/config_plugin_user.gif" width=608 border=0> </p>
<h3>User Info</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User name</strong> - The user name OBO-Edit should use. This 
  information is used in the "saved-by" header field when using the <A 
  href="The_OBO_Adapter.htm">OBO adapter</a>. 
  <li><strong>Full name</strong> - The 
  user's full name. This information is not currently used. 
  <li><strong>Email address</strong> - The user's email address. This 
  information is not currently used.</li></ul>
<h2><a name="textedit"></a>Text Editing</h2>
<p><IMG height=510 hspace=0 
src="../images/config_plugin_textediting.gif" width=608 border=0> </p>
<p> This section controls text-editing behaviors in 
OBO-Edit.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Auto commit text edits</strong> - If this box 
  is checked, OBO-Edit commits text edits as soon as a new term is selected or 
  the ontology is saved. The user does not have to explicitly commit text edits 
  by pressing a "commit" button.
  <li><strong>Warn before discarding text edits</strong> - If <strong>Auto 
  commit text edits</strong> is not selected, this box is enabled. In manual 
  commit mode, the user must press a "commit" button to make text edits 
  permanent. If a user selects a new term without committing their text edits, 
  the edits are lost. If this box is checked, the user will see a warning if 
  uncommitted text edits are about to be discarded.
  <li><strong>Allow extended characters</strong> - If this box is selected, 
  extended (non-ASCII) characters are allowed in term names, synonyms, 
  definitions, etc. Note that this does not guarantee that non-ascii characters 
  will actually be written out to disk. Some data adapters (like the OBO 
  Adapter) currently do not allow extended characters under any circumstances.
  <li><strong>Use Personal Definition</strong> - If this box is selected, a user 
  may specify a default definition and dbxrefs that will automatically be used 
  when a new term is created.s</li></ul>
<a name="display_layout"></a><h2>Display Layout</h2>
<p>This section controls the layout of the main OBO-Edit user interface. Users 
can create a custom layout using a special XML format. Components and plugins 
can be arranged however a user wants:</p>
<p><IMG height=510 hspace=0 
src="../images/config_plugin_layout.gif" width=608 border=0>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The large text box contains the XML code for the layout. See <A 
href="Working_with_XML_Layouts.htm">Customizing the Interface</a> to 
learn how to specify a custom layout.</p>
<p>The xml editor does some syntax highlighting, automatic 
text&nbsp;generating&nbsp;and auto-indenting. The line number and column number 
of the current cursor position are displayed in a label below the xml editor. If 
there is an error in the layout, an error message will appear beneath the xml 
editor when the "Save Configuration" button is pressed.</p>
<p>To automatically indent the XML code, press the 
"Auto-Indent XML" button.</p>
<p>The "Import XML File..." button loads an XML layout file from a local disk. 
The "Export XML File..." button saves the current layout to a file. These 
buttons allow users to share useful layouts with other users.</p>
<p>              
          To return to 
the default OBO-Edit layout, press the "Load default layout" button.</p>
