<H1>The Reasoner and the Interface</H1>
<P>When the reasoner is running, it changes the way the 
ontology is displayed in the ontology editor panel. Some of the implied links 
discovered by the reasoner may be shown in the ontology editor panel. By default, 
these implied links are displayed with a wavy blue arrow:</P>
<P><IMG height=39 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_implied_arrow.gif" width=181 
border=0></P>
<H2>Trimming<A name=trimming></A></H2>
<P>Not all implied links are shown in the ontology editor panel, because doing so 
would quickly make the interface unmanagable. Consider our elephant ontology 
once more:</P>
<P><IMG height=94 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_ontology.gif" 
width=181 border=0></P>
<P>If every single implied link were shown, we would see:</P>
<P><IMG height=171 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_notrimming.gif" 
width=185 border=0></P>
<P>It's easy to imagine how confusing this would get with an ontology of any 
complexity.</P>
<P>To reduce this complexity, OBO-Edit <STRONG>trims</STRONG> the ontology 
before displaying it. Trimming&nbsp;hides links that would unhelpfully clutter 
the display. The reasoner still knows about these links, but they are not shown 
to the user.</P>
<P>A link <STRONG>L</STRONG> is trimmed if it satisfies either of the following 
conditions:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>All evidence for&nbsp;<STRONG>L</STRONG> is based on the transitivity rule 
  <LI><STRONG>L</STRONG>'s child term has any grandparent link with the same 
  relationship type and parent term as <STRONG>L</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>There is one exception: user-created links are never 
trimmed. This means that redundant links are always visible, because all redundant links are 
user-created.</P>
