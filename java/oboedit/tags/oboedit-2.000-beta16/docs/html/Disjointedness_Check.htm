<H1>Disjointedness Check</H1>
<P>This check makes sure that no term has disjoint 
superclasses. That is, if a term has two is_a ancestors which in turn have a 
disjoint_from relationship with each other, the disjointedness check reports an 
error.</P>
<P>An error of this kind signals a serious flaw in the logic of an ontology. 
This error can only be fixed by restructuring the ontology.</P>
<P>This check will only be run if the reasoner is enabled.</P>
