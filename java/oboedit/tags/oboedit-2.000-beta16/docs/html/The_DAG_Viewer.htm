<h1>The DAG Viewer</h1>

<p>The DAG Viewer is a plugin that displays all the possible paths to the 
currently selected term (or terms):</p>

<p><IMG height=298 hspace=0 src="../images/dagview.gif" 
width=328 border=0></p>

<p>This display shows a view of the ontology where every link that does not end 
in the selected term has been removed. Hence, every leaf in this tree is the 
currently selected term.</p>

<p>At the bottom left of the screen is a summary of the number of 
<strong>paths</strong> in the trimmed view. A <strong>path</strong> is a unique 
collection of links that leads from the selected term to the ontology root. In 
the example above, there are 5 paths to the root from "virion transport 
vesicle". Note that even if a term only has one parent, it may have multiple 
paths to the root if one of its ancestor has multiple parents.</p>

<p>    
              
             
             To configure 
the DAG Viewer, press the "Config" button. A configuration window will appear:</p>

<p><IMG height=153 hspace=0 
src="../images/dagview_config.gif" width=238 border=0>    
              
             
               
           </p>

<p>This plugin can be configured via the two checkboxes in the lower right:</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Show paths to multiple 
  selected terms</strong>- If this checkbox is unchecked, the DAG Viewer only 
  displays paths to a single term (the current sub-selection). If this box is 
  checked, the DAG Viewer will show paths to all the currently selected terms. 
  <li><strong>Collapse&nbsp;already 
  shown paths</strong> &nbsp;- In ontologies with lots of multiple 
  parentage, there may be thousands of paths to a single term. All these paths 
  can lead to a huge, jumbled and slow display. If the "Collapse" checkbox is 
  activated, any given subpath is completely expanded only once. If a subpath 
  appears again, it is collapsed. (See the screenshot above for an example. At 
  the top of the display, the relationship"virion transport vesicle 
  -<strong>is_a</strong>-&gt; intracellular membrane-bound 
  organelle" is displayed. Since that relationship has already been shown, the 
  children of "intracellular membrane-bound organelle" are collapsed near the 
  bottom of the display to save space. 
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Calculate paths based on primary selector</span> - Normally,
OBO-Edit shows the "global" path structure, ignoring any filters. If
"Local" is checked, OBO-Edit shows the path structure based on the
current <A href="Working_with_Selections.htm">primary selector</A>'s version of 
  the ontology. Any filters that have been applied to the primary selector will 
  be used when displaying the path structure.
  <li><STRONG>Show non-transitive paths</STRONG>&nbsp;- The 
  DAG Viewer normally doesn't show paths that include non-transitive 
  relationship types. If this&nbsp;box is selected, paths with non-transitive relationships
will be shown.&nbsp;This often leads to a highly cluttered display.</li>
</ul>
