<H1>Basic Concepts and Vocabulary</H1>
<P>This guide uses both technical jargon (of which some is commonly used in the formal ontology field, 
and some is fairly specific to OBO-Edit) and vocabulary that is more 
intuitive to biologists. Technical terms and their synonyms may be used in a 
single sentence.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Classes/Terms </STRONG>- 
  Classes (often called terms) are the concepts described by your ontology. See 
  <A href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm#classes">An Introduction to OBO 
  Ontologies</A> for a detailed discussion of exactly what classes are. For now, 
  realize that they're probably the part of your ontology that you really care 
  about.
  <LI><STRONG>Relations/Relationship types</STRONG> - Relations (often called 
  relationship types in this guide) describe the relationships between terms. 
  <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> and <STRONG>part_of</STRONG> are both relations. See <A 
  href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm#relations" >An Introduction to OBO 
  Ontologies</A>            
           for a more detailed 
  discussion.
  <LI><STRONG>Links/Relationships</STRONG> - When two terms 
  have a relationship to one another, that relationship is called a 
  "relationship" (surprise!). A relationship in OBO-Edit consists of a child 
  term, a relationship type, and a parent term. Relationships are directional: 
  the child term has a relationship of the given type to the parent term. 
  Because a relationship indicates a directional connection between two terms, 
  they are sometimes called "links" in this document.</LI></UL>
