<h1>What is an ontology?</h1>
<p>From dictionary.com:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>ontology 
  <dd>An explicit formal specification of how to represent the objects, concepts 
  and other entities that are assumed to exist in some area of interest and the 
  relationships that hold among them.</dd></dl>
<p>In other words, ontologies represent domains of knowledge by defining 
entities within the domain (and the terms used to refer to them) as well as how 
the entities are related to each other. An ontology thus provides a vocabulary 
for communicating knowledge about a topic, as well as a computable 
representation of the underlying reality.</p>
<p>Many ontologies, including OBO ontologies, model
concepts in terms of classes (types of entities) and relations
(features of an entity). Classes are related to each other via
relations.</p>
<p>Special software (known as a reasoner) can use the network of classes and 
relations in an ontology to check the ontology for errors, discover the logical 
implications of existing structures, and suggest new concepts that might be 
added to the ontology.</p>

<h1>"Ontology"? </h1>
<hr>
<p>Philosophy undergrads&nbsp;always point out that&nbsp;"ontology" is the wrong 
word, since "ontology" refers to an account of everything that exists, including 
things that aren't necessarily knowable. Our "ontologies" describe things in the 
real world, so, if anything, they should be called epistemologies. </p>
<p><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #6495ed">When smart people use poor terminology, 
the reason is almost always historical, and this case is no exception. 
The first ontologies had extremely wide scope, and tried to describe&nbsp;the&nbsp;entire&nbsp;universe 
(the SUMO ontology, for example,&nbsp;contains terms 
like "TeutonicEthnicity", "Cement", and "AuditoriumSeat"). Rumor has it that the 
word "ontology" was adopted by early knowledge representation projects as an 
intentionally hubristic joke. Now we're stuck with it.</font></p>
<p><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #6495ed">If you just can't handle the 
inaccuracy of the term, go out to your car, and gather up all the gloves in your 
glove compartment. Then, use your still-empty hands to massage your temples as 
you reflect on the bitter compromise that is human 
language.</font></p></div>
