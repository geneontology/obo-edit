<H1>Introduction to Verification</H1>
<P>It's not easy to create a well formed OBO ontology. In a 
large ontology, it's easy to make mistakes, from large logical or structural 
errors to small grammatical mistakes in a comment.</P>
<P>The OBO-Edit verification system helps keep these mistakes under control by 
performing error checks at several stages of editing. Fatal errors and non-fatal 
warnings are immediately reported to the user. Many common mistakes can be 
automatically corrected by the verification system.</P>
<H2>Verification Events: How OBO-Edit decides when to check your ontology</H2>
<P>The OBO-Edit verification system performs some checks during each of five 
events:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Load</STRONG> - This 
  event occurs&nbsp;after an ontology is loaded 
  <LI><STRONG>Text Edit</STRONG> - 
  This event occurs whenever term text is edited, immediately before 
  the&nbsp;changes are&nbsp;applied to the ontology. 
  <LI><STRONG>Reasoner</STRONG> - This 
  event occurs when the reasoner is run 
  <LI><STRONG>Save</STRONG>&nbsp; - 
  This event occurs before an ontology is saved 
  <LI><STRONG>Manual Check</STRONG>&nbsp;- This event occurs when a user forces 
  an ontology check from <A href="The_Verification_Plugin.htm">the Verification 
  Plugin</A></LI></UL>
<P>Note that not all checks are performed during each event. Some checks are 
only performed during certain events. The events during which each check is 
performed can be configured in <A href="The_Verification_Plugin.htm">The 
Verification Plugin</A>, but the default settings will work well for most 
ontologies.</P>
<H2>The Special Case of Text Edits</H2>
<P>Some ontology checks can take a long time to run, mostly because each term in 
the ontology must be checked. To keep text edits quick (and error reports easier 
to read), when checks are&nbsp;initiated by the <STRONG>Text Edit</STRONG> 
event, only the currently selected term is checked.</P>
<H2>What OBO-Edit Checks For</H2>
<P>Currently, OBO-Edit can perform the following checks:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="Text_Checks.htm">Comment Check</A>
  <LI><A href="Definition_Check.htm">Definition Check</A>
  <LI><A href="Text_Checks.htm">Name Check</A>
  <LI><A href="Text_Checks.htm">Synonym Check</A>
  <LI><A href="Dangling_Intersection_Check.htm">Dangling Intersection Check</A>
  <LI><A href="Dbxref_Check.htm">Dbxref Check</A>
  <LI><A href="Disjointedness_Check.htm">Disjointedness Check</A>
  <LI><A href="ISA_Cycle_Check.htm"> Cycle Check</A>
  <LI><A href="Name_Redundancy_Check.htm">Name Redundancy Check</A>
  <LI><A href="User_Defined_Checks.htm">User Defined Checks</A> 
</LI></UL>
