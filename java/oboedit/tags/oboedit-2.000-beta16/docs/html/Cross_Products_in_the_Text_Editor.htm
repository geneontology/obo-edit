<h1>Cross Products in the Text Editor</h1>

<h2>  How It Works</h2>
<p>The Cross Products tab creates new intersection 
relationships&nbsp;for a term of interest (that is, the current <A 
href="Working_with_Selections.htm#subselection">sub-selection</A>) based on a 
specified genus and collection of differentia.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Cross 
Products&nbsp;tab&nbsp;does not create any new terms. To create cross-product 
relationships for an existing term, load a term into the text editor panel by <A 
href="Working_with_Selections.htm">selecting</A> it. To create a brand 
new term with a cross product definition, first <A 
href="Adding_New_Terms.htm">create the new term</A>                                                                       and then specify the cross product definition as described below. 

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In order to edit using the Cross Products Tab, you will need to have two, or more, Ontology Editor Panels open. See <A href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">The Ontology Editor Panel help</a> for more information on using multiple ontology editor panels.

<h2>The Cross Products Tab in the Text Editor</h2>
<p> The <A href="Text_Editing.htm">text 
editor</A> contains a tab called "Cross Products":</p>
<p><IMG height=179 hspace=0 
src="../images/cross_product_tab.gif" width=490 border=0></p>
<p>This tab assumes that your cross products conform to the 
genus/differentia method of designating cross products. If you are using 
another, unrecommended method (ie creating random <A 
href="Cross_Products_By_Hand.htm">cross products by hand</A>),&nbsp;this panel 
may behave in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>The genus term is listed at the top. Differentia terms are listed in the 
"Discriminating Relations" section. Each line of this section represents a 
relationship to a term. The drop down box contains the relationship type, and 
the button immediately to the right contains the target (parent) term of this 
relationship.</p>
<p>To the right of each button that contains a term is a 
button marked with a blue circle. Clicking this button causes the term to be 
selected in the ontology editor panel. These buttons are&nbsp;for use 
while&nbsp;browsing, not editing. Clicking one of these buttons will usually 
cause a new term to be loaded into the text editor, so you will lose any pending changes to 
the cross product definition if one of these buttons is clicked.</p>

<h2>Assigning a Genus Term</h2>
<p>In an ontology editor panel that is NOT the primary selection panel, select the term that you wish to use as the genus term. Note that you cannot use the primary selection panel to select the term you wish to use as the genus term because selecting another term will unselect the term of interest for which you are trying to make the cross product relationships.</p>
 
<p>Drag the new genus term onto the button labeled "&lt;drop a genus term&gt;". The text on the button will change to the name of the new genus term. </p>

<p>To assign NO genus term, click the genus term button. The current genus term 
will be removed.</p>
<P>It is possible to create a valid cross-product with no genus term in 
OBO-Edit. It is <STRONG>not recommended</STRONG>.</P>
<h2>Assigning Differentia Terms</h2>
<p>In an ontology editor panel that is NOT the primary selection panel, select a term that you wish to use as a differentia term.

<p>Drop the new differentia term onto the button&nbsp;labelled "drag new terms 
here". A popup menu will appear&nbsp;containing&nbsp;a list of 
all&nbsp;available relationship types in the current ontology. Choose an option 
from the menu to assign a type to your new relationship.</p>
<p>To entirely remove a differentia term, click the garbage can button next to 
the term.</p>
<H2>Committing Changes</H2>
<p> The cross product tab is located inside the <A href="Text_Editing.htm">text 
editor</A>.&nbsp;Therefore, you must click 
the "Commit" button to make your changes permanent. Otherwise, they will be lost 
when you click a new term.</p>
<P>Once changes are committed, OBO-Edit will create the hidden links that record 
your new cross product. If <A href="The_OBO_Edit_Reasoner.htm">the reasoner</A> 
is running, OBO-Edit will try to create inferred <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> links 
based on your new cross-product definition.</P>
