<H1>Cycle Check</H1>
<P>This check&nbsp;reports a warning if any cycle 
is found in the ontology. A cycle is a chain of one or more links that makes a 
term an ancestor of itself. Note that currently only explicit cycles (those
that are in the ontology itself) are reported--cycles that involve implicit
links (found by the reasoner) will not be caught.</p>
