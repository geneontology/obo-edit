<H1>Working with Selections</H1>
<P>There are two notions of selection in OBO-Edit: the global selection, and 
local Ontology Tree Editor panel selections.</P>
<H2>The Global Selection</H2>
<P>The global selection is available to every component in OBO-Edit. Every 
control, plugin, data adapter, etc. can find out which terms are globally 
selected. Some components respond to changes in the global selection. For 
example, the <A href="Tree_Viewer.htm">Tree Viewer</A> changes its 
display when the global selection changes.</P>
<P>Users can change the global selection by left-clicking on relationships in 
the <STRONG>primary</STRONG> <A href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">ontology tree editor 
panel</A>.&nbsp; When a relationship is selected, it will be surrounded by a 
blue box:</P>
<P><IMG  hspace=0 src="../images/primary_selection.png"  
border=0></P>
<P>In the above example, "intracellular organelle" and "non-membrane bounded 
organelle" are selected.</P>
<P> Multiple relationships can be selected at once. To select a contiguous 
list of relationships, select the first item in the list by left-clicking. Then, hold 
the <STRONG>Shift</STRONG> key and click the last item in the list. To select 
several non-continguous terms, left-click on the first term, and select 
subsequent terms by holding down the <STRONG>Ctrl</STRONG> key and left-clicking.</P>
<P>The global selection may be changed in other ways. Other OBO-Edit components 
(like the <A href="Searching.htm">Search</A> control) may change the 
current global selection. If the global selection changes, the primary ontology 
tree editor panel will reflect that change.</P>
<H2>The Sub-Selection<A name=subselection></A> </H2>
<P>Any number of relationships can be selected at a time. However, components 
like the <A href="Text_Editing.htm">text editor</A>&nbsp;can only operate on a 
single term at a time. When multiple relationships are selected at once, a 
single term from the selection (the last one you selected) becomes the sub-selection. When a new selection 
is made, it becomes the default sub-selection.</P>
<P>The sub-selection control contains a list of terms 
consisting of the <STRONG>child terms</STRONG> of all the currently selected 
<STRONG>relationships</STRONG>. This is a very important distinction: the 
current <STRONG>selection</STRONG> is a collection of<STRONG> 
relationships</STRONG>. The <STRONG>sub-selection</STRONG> is a single 
<STRONG>term</STRONG> .</P>
<P>The sub-selection is highlighted in a slightly deeper color than the other 
selected terms:</P>
<P><IMG  hspace=0 src="../images/subselection.png" 
border=0></P>
<H2>What Objects Am I Selecting?</H2>
<P>The global selection and the sub-selection actually designate 
<STRONG>different kinds of objects</STRONG>. This can be confusing for novice 
users.</P>
<P>The global selection (and any local ontology tree editor panel selection) is a 
collection of relationships betwen terms. In the image above, the actual 
selection consists of the following two relationships:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Courier>extracellular organelle <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> 
  organelle</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Courier>non-membrane bounded organelle <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> 
  organelle</FONT></LI></UL>
<P>The sub-selection is a single <EM><STRONG>term</STRONG> or 
<STRONG>relationship type</STRONG></EM>. The sub-selection is always the 
<EM>child term</EM> from one of the relationships in the <EM>global 
selection</EM>.</P>
<P>Ocasionally this guide will refer to the "selected terms". This 
is shorthand for "the child terms of the selected relationships".</P>
<H2>Local Selections</H2>
<P>Terms can also be selected in ontology tree editor panels that are not the primary 
panel. However, when these terms are selected, the global selection does not 
change. Further, these panels do not respond to changes in the global 
selection.</P>
<P>Local selections can be very useful when using drag and drop. For example, a 
user may want to (globally) select a term, and then drag and drop some new 
parents into the cross products tab of the text editor. The user would need to 
select and drag the new parents from a non-primary ontology tree editor panel, so that 
the global selection does not change (if the global selection did change, the 
contents of the text editor would change accordingly, which would make it 
impossible to drag the new terms onto the correct target).<BR></P>
