<H1>Searching</H1>

<P>The main use of filters is for searching. An OBO-Edit search checks
every term or link in the ontology to see if it matches the given filter.
When the search is complete, a list of matching terms is displayed to
the user.</P>

<h2>Term Searches</h2>
<P>The OBO-Edit term search panel looks like this:</P>
<P><IMG src="../images/filter_term_standard.png" border=0></P>
<P>To do a search, first use the filter designer to create 
the filter you want to use. Then click the "Search" button.</P>
<P>When the search is complete, a list of results will appear and a
new tab will be added to the search interface. Term search results
consist of a list of terms that match your search query. Each term's ID and name are
listed:</P>

<p><img hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_term.png" border=0></p>

<P>The search results appear at the top of the tab. To sort the search
results by a particular field (e.g., ID), click the appropriate header
at the top of the search column. Clicking again will reverse-sort by
the same column.</P>

<P>Click a search result to select it. The search result will
automatically be selected in any panel set to global selection
mode.</P>

<p>Each search result panel behaves as a <a
href="Components.htm">component</a> and can be handled separately; by
default, new search results panels appear docked behind the search
panel.</p>

<p>Note that you can control whether or not OBO-Edit includes obsolete terms
in search results.  The default is to include them.  You can exclude obsolete
terms from search results (including dropdown autocomplete lists) by checking
the checkbox for the option "Exclude obsolete terms from search results" in
the <a href="Configuration_manager.htm">Configuration Manager</a>.  If you
change the setting of this option, you will need to quit and restart OBO-Edit
to see the change in search behavior.</p>

<H2>Link Searches</H2>
<P>You can do a link search by choosing "Link Search Panel" from the "Search" menu.
Link search results consist of a list of matching links. For each link, the 
child name, child ID, type ID, parent name, and parent ID are listed:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_link.png" border=0></P>

<p>As with term search results, link search results appear in tabs
that behave as components, and the results can be sorted by clicking
the headers. Clicking on a link in the list selects it in other relevant panels if
you're in
global selection mode; note that because each result is a link, no
selection will appear in the Text Editor.</p>

<h2>Configuring Search Results Headers</h2>
<p>
To control what information appears at the top of each search result panel, click the wrench icon. A configuration panel appears:
</p>
<p><img hspace=0 src="../images/search_panel_config.png" border=0></p>

<p>Check the first box to show the words "Search results:" at the top. Use the pulldown to select whether to show the number of matches ("Result Count"), the search parameters ("Query Expression") or no additional text.
</p>

<h2>Saving Search Results to a File</h2>
<p>
You can save just the ontology terms that matched a particular search. The
way to do this is with a <a href="Loading___Saving.htm#filter">filtered save</a>.
