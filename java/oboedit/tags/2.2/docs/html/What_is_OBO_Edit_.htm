<h1>What is OBO-Edit?</h1>
<p>OBO-Edit is an open source, platform-independent application for viewing
  and editing ontologies.  It was originally designed for use with OBO
  ontologies, but it can now handle several other ontology formats as well.
</p>
<p>OBO-Edit is a graph-based tool; its emphasis on the overall graph structure 
of an ontology provides a friendly interface for biologists, and makes 
OBO-Edit excellent for the rapid generation of large ontologies focusing on 
relationships between relatively simple classes.</p>
<p><a
href="http://www.slideshare.net/dosumis/from-obo-to-owl-and-back-building-scalable-ontologies">This
tutorial</a> provides a good introduction to the use of OBO-Edit, especially for some of the
more advanced features, such as the reasoner and cross-products.</p>
<h2>A Brief History of OBO-Edit</h2>
<p>    OBO-Edit began life as GO-Edit, a tool designed 
exclusively for use in editing the Gene Ontology. As more and more projects began 
to adopt the Gene Ontology standards for ontologies, GO-Edit became 
more flexible to accommodate the needs of more diverse ontologies. Eventually, GO-Edit 
became so general that it was renamed DAG-Edit, because DAG-Edit "ontologies" were a 
special sort of Directed Acyclic Graph.</p>
<p>DAG-Edit was a useful, fairly configurable tool. However, the 
code carried a lot of baggage from its former life as GO-Edit. And at its 
heart, DAG-Edit was really a program for editing labeled, directed graphs, not 
an ontology editor. DAG-Edit users began to have more and more complex needs for 
their ontologies. The Open Biomedical Ontologies project developed a new, much 
more expressive file format for describing ontologies. It was time for DAG-Edit 
to undergo another transformation.</p>
<p>So DAG-Edit became OBO-Edit, hopefully to be renamed for the last time. 
OBO-Edit is 
faster, more memory efficient, and more fully featured than its ancestors. 
OBO-Edit is a complete (if simple) ontology editor, with full support for the 
OBO ontology format (as well as several other ontology file formats, such as
GO and OWL).</p>

<h2>OBO-Edit 2: The Sequel</h2>
<p>In October 2007, the decision was made to split the OBO-Edit code
into three modular and reusable projects, known as bbop, obo, and
oboedit.  At the same time, the user interface of OBO-Edit was
radically improved and revised (a process that is still under way).</p>

<p>This user guide has been updated to correspond to OBO-Edit 2. If
you notice anything missing, out of date, or otherwise inaccurate in
it, please use our bug tracker
at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36855&atid=418257">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36855&atid=418257</a>
to report the discrepancy.</p>

<h2>People</h2>
<p> OBO-Edit was orginally developed by John Day-Richter.</p>
<p>Nomi Harris, Amina Abdulla, Jennifer Deegan, Heiko Dietze, Chris Mungall, Nicolas
Rodriguez and Nicole Washington have contributed additional
programming.</p>
<p>Many OBO-Edit Working Group members have contributed to testing,
documentation, etc., including Midori Harris, Tanya Berardini, Marcus Chibucos, Karen Christie, Laurel Cooper,
Wasila Dahdul, Alex Diehl, Harold Drabkin, Karen Eilbeck, Erika Feltrin, Rebecca Foulger, Melissa Haendel,
Wacek Kusnierczyk, Terry Meehan, David Osumi-Sutherland, Paola Roncaglia, Ramona
Walls, and others.</p.
