<H1>How Do I Spell Check?</H1>

<p>Spell checking
is integrated into the <a href="Text_Checks.htm">Text Checks</a>
portion of the verification system. OBO-Edit comes with a dictionary;
you can also add words to your personal user dictionary. Both of these
are stored in oboedit_config/dict. Words that are
not found in either dictionary are shown in red. If you click the right
mouse button while hovering over a red word, you will be offered the option
to add it to the default or user dictionary.</p>
