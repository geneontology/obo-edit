<h1>Cross Products in the Text Editor</h1>

<h2> How It Works</h2>

<p>The Cross Products tab in the Text Editor allows you to create new intersection relationships for a
term of interest (that is, the current <a
href="Working_with_Selections.htm#subselection">sub-selection</a>)
based on a specified genus and collection of differentia. The Cross
Products tab does not create any new terms. To create cross-product
relationships for an existing term, load the term into the Text Editor
panel by <a href="Working_with_Selections.htm">selecting</a> it. To
create a brand new term with a cross product definition, first <a
href="Adding_New_Terms.htm">create the new term</a>, and then specify
the cross product definition as described below.</p>

<h2>The Cross Products Tab in the Text Editor</h2>
<p> The <A href="Text_Editing.htm">text 
editor</A> has a tab called "Cross Products":</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 
src="../images/cross_product_tab.png" border=0></p>

<p>This tab assumes that your cross products conform to the
genus/differentia method of designating cross products.</p>

<p>The genus term is listed at the top of the Cross Products tab. Differentia terms are listed
in the "Discriminating Relations" section. Each line of the Discriminating Relations section
represents a relationship to a term. The dropdown box on the left contains the
relationship type, and the text box immediately to the right contains
the target (parent) term of this relationship.</p>

<p>To the right of each term name in the Cross Products editor is a button marked
with a fuzzy light blue circle. Clicking this button causes that term to be
selected in the Ontology Tree Editor panel (in place of the currently shown
term). The fuzzy circle buttons are intended for use while
browsing, not editing. Clicking one of these buttons will usually
cause a new term to be loaded into the Text Editor, so you could lose
any pending changes to the cross product definition if one of these
buttons is clicked (though the Text Editor should warn you that you have
unsaved changes, and give you the opportunity to hit Cancel).</p>

<h2>Assigning a Genus Term</h2>

<p>To add a new genus term, type part of a term name or ID into the
Intersection Genus box. After a brief pause, a dropdown menu of term names that contain
the characters you typed will appear; click on one to select it. (Note that
the dropdown menu includes only the top ten matches to the string you entered;
there may be more matching terms than that.)</p>

<!-- <p>To assign NO genus term, click the garbage can button to the left of the genus -->
<!-- term. The current genus term (plus any differentia) will be removed.</p> -->
<p>There is currently no way to delete an unwanted genus in the Cross Product
Editor (a genus trash can is in the works). For now, you may need to use the
Parent Editor to delete unwanted genuses.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to create a valid cross-product with differentia and no genus term
in OBO-Edit; however, this is <strong>not recommended</strong>.</p>

<h2>Assigning Differentia Terms</h2>

<p>You can assign differentia terms by clicking the button that says &quot;Click
(or drop) here to add a new differentia&quot; and then typing or pasting a
term name or ID into the text box. As described above, as you start typing, an
autocomplete dropdown menu will appear, which you can choose from. To assign
the relationship for the differentia, use the pulldown menu of relationships.</p>

<p>Another way to add a differentia is to drag a term onto the &quot;Click
(or drop) here to add a new differentia&quot; button.
The easiest way to do this is to have two (or
more) Ontology Tree Editor Panels open, because you
will need to select the
differentia term(s) in an Ontology Tree Editor panel that's in local
selection mode. See the <A
href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">Ontology Tree Editor Panel page</a>
for more information on using multiple Ontology Tree Editor panels.</p>
<p>In an Ontology Tree Editor panel that is in local selection mode,
select a term that you wish to use as a differentia term. Note that you
cannot use the primary selection panel to select the term you wish to
use as the differentia term because selecting another term will unselect the
term of interest for which you are trying to make the cross product
relationships.</p>

<p>Drop the new differentia term onto the button labelled &quot;Click
(or drop) here to add a new differentia&quot;. A popup menu will
appear containing a list of all available relationship types in the
current ontology. Choose an option from the menu to assign a type to
your new relationship.</p>

<p>To remove a differentia term, click the garbage can button
to the right of the unwanted differentia. 
If you've accidentally gotten into a state where you have
a differentia but no genus, that may not work--you may need to use the Parent
Editor to get rid of the differentia.</p>

<!-- you will need to use the Genus garbage can button that's -->
<!-- to the left of the Intersection Genus line.</p> -->

<h2>Saving and reasoning</H2>

<p>If you are in autocommit mode, changes to the cross products are automatically saved when you move on to another
term. If you aren't, then click the Commit button in the Text Editor to save
your changes. OBO-Edit will create the hidden links that record your new cross
product. If <a href="The_OBO_Edit_Reasoner.htm">the reasoner</a> is
running, OBO-Edit will try to create inferred <strong>is_a</strong>
links based on your new cross-product definition.</p>
