<h1>Adding New Relationships</h1>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by</strong>: Drag-and-drop, right-click</p>
<p><strong>Hotkeys</strong>: Command+C, Command+P</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: One or more source relationships required</p>
<P><STRONG>Target requirement</STRONG>: One target required</P>
</div>
<p>New relationships can be added by drag-and-drop, or via the right-click 
menu.</p>
<p>To create one or more new relationships, select a collection of source 
relationships that you would like to relate to a new term. Then, select a target 
term to which they will be related by right-clicking the target term or by 
drag-and-drop.</p>
<p>From the right-click menu or the drag and drop popup menu, you may add new 
relationships using the "Add parent term" or "Add child term" menu options. Note 
that the names of these operations refer to changes that will occur to the 
<strong>target</strong> term. So if you drag term A onto term B and choose "Add 
parent term", A will become a new parent of B.</p>
<p>Both the "Add parent term" and "Add child term" menu items have a flyout 
submenu of the relationship type that should be used when creating the new 
relationship:</p>

border=0></p>
<p>Select the relationship type you would like for the new 
relationship, and it will be created. If you would like the new relationship to 
use the same relationship type as the original source relationship, use the "Use 
original type" menu option. This is particularly useful if you are creating 
several relationships at once by using a number of source relationships. If "Use 
original type" is used with untyped source relationships (ie one or more of your 
sources is an ontology root) the <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> relationship is used.</p>

<h2>Hotkeys</h2>

<p> When dragging, you can use hotkeys to specify the "Add parent
term" or "Add child term" edit operations. To specify "Add child
term", press the "Command" and "C" keys on the keyboard, then start
dragging. The hotkey dropdown menu will change to "Add child term
(copy)" and the title above the terms you are dragging will change
from "Dragging" to "Add child...":</p>

width=288 border=0></p>
<p>When the term is dropped, the type selection menu will 
pop up.</p>

<p>To specify "Add parent term", press the "Command" and "P" keys on
the keyboard, then start dragging. The hotkey dropdown menu will
change to "Add parent term" and title above the terms you are dragging
will change from "Dragging" to "Add parent..."</p>

<p>Note that if you want to use hotkeys to drag from one Ontology
Editor Panel to another, you must specify the "Add child" (or "Add
parent") operation in <strong>both</strong> Ontology Editor
Panels.</p>

<p>You can also use hotkeys to choose which relationship type will be
assigned when you drop the dragged terms. Each relationship type is
assigned a hotkey (Command+another key, usually just the number that
corresponds to the relationship type's position in the list, but IS_A
always gets the hotkey "I").</p>

<h1>Where did the "copy" menu item go?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Long-time users of DAG-Edit might be wondering where the "Copy" menu item 
went.&nbsp;The "Add parent term" and "Add child term" menu items have replaced 
"copy". In fact, "Add 
child term" does exactly the same thing as the old "Copy" menu item.
</p>
<p>We originally called this operation "Copy" because it made a term appear in 
the graph more than once; a "copy" was created. Over time, we realized that 
"Copy" was a misleading name. Many new users of DAG-Edit thought that an 
entirely new term was being generated.</p>

<h2>Adding New Relationship Types</h2>
<p>Adding a new relationship type is a special case of <a href="Adding_New_Terms.htm">adding a new term</a>.</p>

<h1>Why is my new relationship type not showing up in OBO-Edit?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
OBO-Edit can display any relationships that are specified in an OBO
file.  However, older versions of OBO-Edit were configured with a default global filter
that hid all non-transitive relationships.
If you
are not seeing your new relationship type, then it is probably not marked as a
transitive relationship, and furthermore, you have old configuration files
left over from an earlier OBO-Edit version.
Here's what you should do:
<ul>
<li> If the relationship is transitive, make sure that it is marked
transitive. Select the relationship in the Ontology Editor Panel, and
tick the "Is transitive?" box in the Text Editor. When you save the
file, the tag "is_transitive: true" will be included in the OBO file.
<li> Bring up the Global Filters component
  ([Config] -> [Global Filters]). Then select 
"Link filters" and see if there is a filter that says <em>Select links where
  Type that have a Is_Transitive.</em></p>
</ul>
