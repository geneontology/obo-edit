<h1>Organizing Your Ontology: Editing Metadata</h1>
<p> 
Metadata are data about data. In the context of ontologies, metadata describe
properties of the ontology overall, rather than properties of individual terms
or relationships in the ontology. Ontology metadata could include information
such as the URL where the official version of the ontology lives; the date it
was last updated; a contact person for the ontology. In OBO-Edit, the types of metadata
that can be viewed and edited are:
<ul>
<li> <a href="Working_with_Categories.htm">Subsets</a> to which terms can be assigned
<li> <a href="The_ID_Manager_Plugin.htm">ID generation profiles</a>
<li> <a href="Working_with_Namespaces.htm">Namespaces</a>
<li> <a href="Working_with_Synonym_Categories.htm">Synonym types</a>
<li> <a href="Editing_Obsoletes.htm">Obsolete terms or relations</a>
</ul></p>
<p>To access these panels, use the Metadata menu items.
