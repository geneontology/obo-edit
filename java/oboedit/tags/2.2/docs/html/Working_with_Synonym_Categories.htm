<h1>Working with Synonym Types</h1>
<p> Every OBO ontology contains a set of synonym types. Synonyms in
the ontology can be assigned to one of the <em>synonym types</em> in
that set (see <A href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm">An
Introduction to OBO Ontologies</A>, and <A
href="Text_Editing.htm">Text Editing</A>&nbsp;for more information on
how to assign synonyms to synonym types).</p>
<p>The built-in Synonym Type Manager allows users to manage the set of
available synonym types.  To access the Synonym Type Manager, choose
"Synonym Type Manager" from the menu under [Metadata].

<h2>Committing Changes</h2>
<p>Any changes made in the Synonym Type Manager are not saved until the 
"Save Changes" button is clicked. If changes are made and the window is closed, 
<strong>the changes will not be saved</strong>. To revert to the last committed version 
of the synonym type set, click the "Revert" button.</p>
<h2>Editing an Existing Synonym Type</h2>
<p>To edit an existing synonym type, click the synonym type to edit in the list on the left. 
The synonym type editor panel will appear:</p>

<p>Synonym types have three attributes: a&nbsp;type id, a descriptive
name, and a synonym scope. To change the synonym type id, click the
synonym type id in the text field and type a new name. To change the
descriptive name, click the synonym type description in the text field
and type a new description. To change the type scope, select a new
scope from the dropdown menu. If the synonym type should not have a
required scope, choose "&lt;unspecified scope&gt;" from the
dropdown. Synonyms that use this type can have a scope specified in
the text editor, rather than automatically using the built-in synonym
type scope.</p>
<h2>Deleting an Existing Synonym Type</h2>
<p>To delete an existing synonym type, click the synonym type to delete in the list on the 
left. Click the Del button to remove the synonym type.</p>
<p>  Note that a synonym type that is assigned to a term cannot be deleted. If 
a synonym type is deleted that is still in use, a warning will appear when 
the "Save Changes" button is pressed. If a synonym type must be deleted, first 
<A href="Searching.htm">search</A> the ontology to make sure that the synonym type 
is not in use.</p>
<h2>Adding a New Synonym Type</h2>
<p>To add a new synonym type, click the "Add" button. A new synonym
type will be created with the default name "NEWSYNTYPE", the default
description "&lt;new synonym type&gt;" and a scope set to
"&lt;unspecified scope&gt;". Edit the name and description as
described above.</p>
