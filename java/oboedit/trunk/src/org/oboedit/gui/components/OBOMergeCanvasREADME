The GUI components in the OBOMergeCanvas programme were created using MyEclipse Matisse GUI Builder from:

MyEclipse Enterprise Workbench
Version: 6.0.1 GA
Build id: 6.0.1-GA-200710

Both org.oboedit.gui.components.OBOMergeCanvas.java and org.oboedit.gui.components.OBOMergeCanvas.form are 
needed to make changes to the OBOMergeCanvas GUI. 

To use this GUI builder to make changes, you need to open the source code in MyEclipse and then double click OBOMergeCanvas.form 
(rather than the .java file). This will open the GUI in the Matisse editor, and will enable the automated code generation software to 
continue updating changes automatically. It is also important  to configure the software to generate code that is 
compliant with the java level that OBO-Edit is currently using. At the time of writing this is java 5.
