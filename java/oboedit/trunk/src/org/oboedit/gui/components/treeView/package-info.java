 * The Tree Viewer package. The Tree Viewer displays a tree style representation of
 * the graph running up to the ontology root, and down to the term or terms 
 * selected in the Ontology Tree Editor. All possible paths from leaf node to root 
 * are shown in this view, and the graph is not editable in this component.
 * 
 * This package is currently under construction. The version of the Tree Viewer 
 * currently in use is in org.oboedit.gui.components. The old version is configured
 * via an options button, whereas this version will be configured via the 
 * wrench icon.
