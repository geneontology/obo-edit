<h1>Text Editing</h1>
<p>
The Text Editor panel allows you to edit all the attributes of a term.  
<A 
href="Working_with_Selections.htm">Sub-select</A> a term in the Ontology
Editor Panel to load it into the text 
editor:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/text_editor.png" border=0></p>

<H2>Committing Your Changes</H2>
<P>OBO-Edit does not immediately apply text edits; instead, it tries to group edits 
together so that the behavior of "Undo" makes more sense (you wouldn't want to 
have to undo each and every letter typed, for example). OBO-Edit has two modes 
for making text edits permanent: <STRONG>auto-commit mode</STRONG> and 
<STRONG>manual commit mode.</STRONG></P>
<P>In <STRONG>auto-commit mode</STRONG>, text edits are applied as soon as a new 
term is selected or the ontology is saved. To commit edits immediately, press 
Ctrl+Enter.</P>
<P>In <STRONG>manual commit mode</STRONG>, text edits are applied when the 
"Commit" button in the Text Editor is pressed. The "Commit" button is only visible in manual commit 
mode.</P>
<P>See the <A href="The_Configuration_Plugin.htm#textedit">Text Editing section 
of the Configuration Manager</A> page for information about choosing the text editing 
mode.</P>
<p>Note that you can't Undo changes made in the Text Editor until you've
committed your changes as above (select a different term or click the Commit
button).</p>

<h2>Text Checking</h2>
<p>The Text Editor performs <a href="Text_Checks.htm">text checks</a> on the
selected term.  If there are any errors or warnings, this is indicated in the
  Text Editor title bar.  To see the warnings, hover your
mouse over the title bar for a few seconds; a window listing the warnings will
pop up:
</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/text_warnings.png" border=0></p>
</p>

<h2>Basic Term Attributes</h2>
<p>At the top of the Text Editor, you will see the basic attributes of the
selected term.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ID</strong> - The id of 
  the term. The id cannot be edited. 
  <li><strong>Namespace</strong> - The 
  namespace (aka the ontology name) of this term. The namespace can be changed 
  by selecting a different namespace from the dropdown list. The list of 
  available namespaces can be edited using <A 
  href="Working_with_Namespaces.htm">the Namespace Manager Plugin</A>.
  <li><strong>Term Name</strong> - The term's display name can be edited in this 
  text box.</li></ul>
<h2>Tabs</h2>
<p>In order to fit all of the possible editing options onto 
one screen, some editing options are organized into tabs. To access a tab, click 
the tab name. Tabs that currently contain information are marked with an 
asterisk.</p>
<p><strong>Definition Tab</strong></p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/text_definition.png" border=0></p>
<p>Definition text and definition dbxrefs can be edited here. There are two 
fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Definition</strong> - This 
  contains the definition text. 
  <li><strong>Dbxrefs</strong> 
  -&nbsp;Definition dbxrefs provide a reference explaining the origin of the 
  definition. To add a new dbxref, click the + button. To delete a dbxref, first click it to select the dbxref, and
  then click the - button. To edit a dbxref, or to have the full 
  set of dbxref editing tools, double-click the dbxref id.  A dbxref editing panel
  will appear:<br>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/text_definition_dbxref.png" border=0></p>
  </li></ul>
<p>See the <a href="#dbxref">Dbxrefs Tab</a> section below for more information
about editing dbxrefs.

<p><strong>Comment Tab</strong></p>
<p>The comment associated with the current term can be viewed and modified in this text area.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Product Tab</strong></p>
<p>Please refer to <A href="Cross_Products_in_the_Text_Editor.htm">Cross Products in the 
Text Editor</A>.</p>

<p><strong>Dbxrefs Tab</strong><a 
name="dbxref"></a> </p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/text_definition_dbxref.png" border=0></p>
<p>This tab allows the user to add, edit, and remove general dbxrefs associated
with the selected term. General 
dbxrefs are used to provide mappings between a term and a term in another 
vocabulary.</p>
<p>To edit a dbxref, double-click it in the list. When the dbxref is selected, 
it will be loaded in the dbxref editor, which contains the following 
fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Database name</strong> - 
  Contains the dbxref database name--the part of the dbxref 
  that appears to the left of the colon. For example, in the dbxref 
  "EC:1.8.1.7", the database name is "EC". 
  <li><strong>ID</strong> - 
  Contains the dbxref database id--the part of the dbxref that 
  appears to the right of the colon. For example, in the dbxref "EC:1.8.1.7", 
  the database id is "1.8.1.7". 
  <li><strong>Description</strong> - A descriptive name for the 
dbxref.</li></ul>
<p>To add a new dbxref, click the "+" button. A new dbxref "XX:&lt;new 
dbxref&gt;" will be created.  Modify the fields as desired.  To save
your new dbxref and close the dbxref editor, click somewhere in the
gray area in the dbxref editor panel.</p>
<p>To remove a dbxref, select the dbxref to remove, and click the "-" button.</p>

<p><strong>Synonyms Tab</strong></p>
<p>Synonyms are alternate names for a term.  Not all terms have synonyms.  If
your currently selected term has synonyms, you will see them in the synonym tab.</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/synonym_tab.png" border=0></p>
<p>To edit a synonym, double-click it. The synonym panel will turn into a
synonym editor panel:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/synonym_editor.png" border=0></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Name</strong> - 
  The actual synonym name. 
  <li><strong>Scope</strong> - The synonym scope indicates how specific 
  this synonym is. To choose a new scope, select it from the drop down list. The 
  possible values are:
   <ul>
     <li><strong>Related synonym</strong> 
    - The catch-all scope. This means that this synonym has a slightly different 
    meaning than the term name, so it can't be said to be more or less specific 
    in scope. Related synonyms are often phrases that a user might use when 
    searching for a term. For example, sometimes the Gene Ontology 
    will specify a well-known gene product name as a related synonym of&nbsp;the associated&nbsp;function or 
    process term to aid in searching.&nbsp; 
     <li><strong>Exact synonym</strong> 
    - Indicates that this synonym means exactly the same thing as the term name.
     <li><strong>Narrow synonym</strong> - Indicates that this synonym means something more specific 
    than the term name.
     <li><strong>Broad synonym</strong> 
    - Indicates that this synonym means something less specific than the term 
    name. </li>
   </ul>Note that some synonym categories have a built-in scope (for 
  example, a category like "UK Spelling" would have a built-in scope of "exact", 
  because every synonym in this category would be an exact synonym; see <A 
  href="Working_with_Synonym_Categories.htm">Working with Synonym Categories</A>      for more information). If 
  the synonym belongs to&nbsp;a category with a built-in scope, the scope cannot 
  be edited. 
  <li><strong>Synonym type</strong> - 
  Indicates the synonym category to which this synonym belongs. Synonym 
  categories allow synonyms to be grouped into different types. To choose a new 
  synonym category, select it from the dropdown list. To add, edit, or delete a 
  synonym category, use <A href="Working_with_Synonym_Categories.htm">the 
  Synonym Category Manager Plugin</A>.
  <li><strong>DbXrefs</strong> - Synonym dbxrefs indicate a literature reference 
  that explains the origin of the synonym. To add a new dbxref to this synonym,
  click the "+" button next to the Scope pulldown:
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/synonym_dbxref_editor.png" border=0></p>
<p>  The interface for modifying the synonym dbxref list is exactly 
  the same as the interface for modifying general dbxrefs (described
  above).</p>
</ul>
<p>To add a new synonym, click the "Add" button. When you are done editing your new
synonym, click somewhere in the gray area in the synonym editor panel to commit it
and close the synonym editor.
<p>To remove a synonym, select the synonym to remove, and click the "-" button.</p>

</li>
<p><strong>Categories Tab</strong></p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/category_tab.png" border=0></p>
<p>Categories are used to designate subsets of terms within an ontology. The 
categories tab contains a list of the available categories in the ontology. If the 
selected term is a member of a category, the checkbox to the right will be 
checked. To change whether the term belongs to a particular category, check or 
uncheck the appropriate checkbox.</p>
<p>To edit the list of available categories, use the <A 
href="Working_with_Categories.htm">Category Manager</A>.</p>
<h2>Relation-Specific Attributes</h2>
<p>The display is slightly different when a relation (rather than a class) has 
been selected.</p>
<p><IMG src="../images/relation-text-edit.png" border=0></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Range</strong> - The 
  relation range restricts the possible parents for any relationship that uses 
  this relation. If this relation is listed as a relationship type in a given 
  relationship, the parent of that relationship must be a subclass of this 
  relation's range. To set a new range, drag a term onto the blue range button. 
  To clear the range, click the blue range button. See <A 
  href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm">An Introduction to OBO 
  Ontologies</A> for more information about range.
  <li><strong>Domain</strong> - The 
  relation domain restricts the possible children for any relationship that uses 
  this relation. If this relation is listed as a relationship type in a given 
  relationship, the child of that relationship must be a subclass of this 
  relation's domain. To set a new domain, drag a term onto the blue&nbsp;domain 
  button. To clear the domain, click the blue&nbsp;domain button. See <A 
  href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm">An Introduction to OBO 
  Ontologies</A> for more information about domain.
  <li><strong>Is transitive</strong> - If 
  this box is checked, the relationship type is transitive. It is very important 
  to that this box is marked correctly; the OBO-Edit reasoner makes extensive 
  use of this information. If the transitive status of a relation is incorrectly 
  indicated, the reasoner may make many incorrect inferences. 
  <li><strong>Is symmetric</strong> - If this box is checked, the relationship 
  type is symmetric. It is very important to mark this box correctly; 
  the OBO-Edit reasoner makes extensive use of this information. If the 
  symmetric status of a relation is incorrectly indicated, the reasoner may make 
  many incorrect inferences.
  <li><strong>Is cyclic</strong> -<a 
  name=is_cyclic></a>  <a 
  name=is_cyclic></a>  If this 
  box is checked, it is legal to create cycles out of this relationship type. 
  That is, it is legal to say that a term has a relationship to itself over this 
  relation. Note that if "Is cyclic" isn't selected, even indirect cycles (that 
  is, cycles that are made of implied relationships) are illegal.
