<h1>Explanations</h1>
<p>The Explanations panel displays the explanation for any 
currently selected links. When the Explanations panel is opened, it looks like 
this:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 
src="../images/explanation.png" border=0></p>
<p>The Explanations panel contains a plain text explanation 
of why the selected link exists. The explanation may contain a number of 
hyperlinks. If a term name or link description&nbsp;is hyperlinked, clicking the 
link will cause the term or link to be selected in the primary ontology 
editor.</p>
<p>Sometimes an explanation for an implied link will cite 
other links that were used as evidence to create the implied link. These 
evidence links may be followed by a bold hyperlink titled <STRONG>show 
explanation.</STRONG> If a <STRONG>show explanation</STRONG> link is clicked, 
the explanation for the associated link will appear beneath the link, and the 
link text will change to <STRONG>hide explanation.</STRONG> The 
<STRONG>show/hide explanation</STRONG> links can be used to follow the chains of 
implications the reasoner often uses to create an implied link.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Explanations panel is a checkbox 
labeled <STRONG>Show verbose explanations</STRONG>. If this checkbox is 
selected, additional text may be displayed clarifying how a particular reasoner 
rule works. Experienced users may decide to turn off this additional text to 
simplify the display, especially when a lot of sub-explanations are also being 
displayed.</p>
