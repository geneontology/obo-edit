<H1>The Parent Editor</H1>
<P>The Parent Editor displays the immediate parents of the 
current <A href="Working_with_Selections.htm">sub-selection</A>&nbsp;term:</P>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/parent_editor.png" border=0></p>

<P>The name and ID of the sub-selected term appear at the top of the
panel. Each additional line in the display represents a parent link
from the currently selected term to another term. The fields in each
line are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Delete button</STRONG> - Press this button (with
  trashcan icon) to delete this parent link. (Note that this option is
  not available if a term has only one parent; to delete the last
  parent from a term, thereby making the term obsolete, use the <a
  href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">Ontology Tree Editor.</a></LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Relationship type</STRONG> - This is a dropdown list of
  all the relationship types in the ontology. The current relationship
  type for this link is selected. To change the relationship type of
  this link, choose a new item from the dropdown list.
  <LI><STRONG>Parent term - </STRONG>This is the id and name of the
  parent term of this link. Click the id to select the parent term.
  <LI><STRONG>Cardinality control</STRONG> - Pops up a separate window
  to let you set the cardinality of this link.  This information is
  not currently used.
  <LI><STRONG>Namespace control</STRONG> - This is a list of all the
  namespaces in the ontology. This current namespace for this link is
  selected. To change the namespace of this link, select a new
  namespace from the dropdown.
  <LI><STRONG>Show implied links</STRONG> - Checking this checkbox will make
  implied parents appear in the editor; if the box is not checked,
  only asserted parents appear. Note that the reasoner must be running
  for this option to work.
</UL>
<P>To add a new parent link to the selected term, drag the parent term
onto the "Local-select other terms and drop here to add new parents"
panel. A new link will be added with the dropped term as the parent,
and <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> as the relationship type. Change the
relationship type as needed.</P>
<p>Note that you have to drag the desired new parent from an Ontology
Tree Editor that is in <b>local</b> selection mode, because you don't
want the global selection to change. The most convenient way to do
this is to have two Ontology Tree Editor panels open, with one in
global and the other in local mode. Select the child in the global
tree editor panel (which makes it the selected term in the Parent
Editor), then drag the desired new parent from the local tree editor
panel into the Parent Editor. To add a parent using a single Ontology
Tree Editor panel, select the child with the OTE in global mode, then
change to local mode before dragging the new parent.</p>
