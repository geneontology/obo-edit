<h1>Is OBO-Edit2 running slowly?</h1>
Several of the components in OBO-Edit2 can cause slow performance.  The
easiest solution is to turn off components that you are not using.  The
biggest culprits are:
<ul>
<li> The Reasoner</li>
<li> The Graph Editor </li>
<li> The Parent Editor </li>
<li> The Verification Manager </li>
</ul>
<p>To turn off the Graph Editor or the Parent Editor, simply remove them from
  your layout.</p>
<p>You can tell if the Reasoner is on because the OBO-Edit titlebar will say
  "REASONER ON".  To turn the Reasoner off, bring up the Reasoner Manager
  ([Reasoner] -> [Reasoner Manager]) and select "OFF" from the pulldown list.
Unless you specifically need the Reasoner, it's best to leave it off, because
  it uses a lot of memory and slows down OBO-Edit a lot.
</p>
<h2>The Verification Manager</h2>
<p>
When is the application running slowly? Is it when you are loading the
file, commiting a term edit, or making the edit itself?
If the slowness occurs at specific times then it may be because you are
running verification checks that you are not aware of. To find this
out, open the <a href="The_Verification_Plugin.htm">Verification Manager</a>
component ([Tools] -> [Verification Manager]).
The verification manager controls look like this:<br>

<br>
If you are experiencing slowness in one area of your editing, it is
likely that you are running a lot of verification checks at just one
stage of editing, and if you wish, you may turn off these checks and
just run them manually on demand. The different points when checks can
be run are all listed here, and for discussion I have labelled them A
to G. (Below)<br>

<h3>Types of slowness:</h3>
<br>
1) Application slow to load the ontology file.<br>
<br>
This may be because you are running a lot of checks on loading your
ontology file. To solve this problem uncheck the boxes above label 'E'.
You may want to run the verification checks manually at a more
appropriate time by checking the relevant boxes labelled 'F' and
clicking the 'Run Manual Check' button (see Figure 1).<br>
<br>
2) Application slow to select a new term in the ontology editor panel
after a text change has been made in the Text Editor Panel. <br>
<br>
It is likely that you have several checks enabled 'On text commit'. To
solve this problem uncheck the boxes above label 'A'. You may want
to run the verification checks manually at a more appropriate time
by checking the relevant boxes labelled 'F' and clicking the 'Run
Manual Check' button.<br>
<br>
3) Application slow to apply text edits. <br>
<br>
It is likely that you have several checks enabled 'On text edit'. To
solve this problem uncheck the boxes above label 'B'. You may want
to run the verification checks manually at a more appropriate time
by checking the relevant boxes labelled 'F' and clicking the 'Run
Manual Check' button.<br>
<br>
You may wish to keep the 'Definition check' enabled so that the
application will underline spelling errors and typos as you work. <br>
<br>
4) Application is slow to save the ontology file. <br>
<br>
It is likely that you have several checks enabled 'On save'. To
solve this problem uncheck the boxes above label 'D'. You may want
to run the verification checks manually at a more appropriate time
by checking the relevant boxes labelled 'F' and clicking the 'Run
Manual Check' button.<br>
<br>
5) Application is slow to run the reasoner. <br>
<br>
The reasoner is slow on any large or complex ontology--we are working on
improving this.  However, it is also possible that verification checks
are making the reasoner slower.
It is likely that you have several checks enabled 'On reasoner'. To
solve this problem uncheck the boxes above label 'C'. You may want
to run the verification checks manually at a more appropriate time
by checking the relevant boxes labelled 'F' and clicking the 'Run
Manual Check' button.<br>
