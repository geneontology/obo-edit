<h1>OBO Merge User Interface</h1>
<div class="tabbed">
</div>
The obomerge command line utility allows you to merge two ontology
files that have been edited independently. You can also access
this utility via the OBO Merge user interface. <br>
<br>
The interface in its basic form allows you to enter the file paths to
several files:<br>
<ul>
  <li> the original file from
which the two files diverged.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>the two edited files (changed files 1 and 2). When you enter 
these two files paths you should be careful about the order as the 
changes in changed file 1 will take precedence over the changes in 
changed file 2.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>the location where you would like
to save the merged output file. <br>
  </li>
</ul> 
If you use the interface in this basic 
form then default configuration values will be used. Firstly the utility will 
fail if differently named terms with the same term identifier have been 
added to the two edited files. Secondly the merged output file in the case of success will 
be in OBO 1.2 format. <br>

If you click the 'Advanced' button then you will have the option to 
alter various controls on the utility. These have a range of effects 
and are fully explained in the <a href="../obomerge.htm">obomerge utility help guide</a>.<br>

<br> 
Once you have entered the full set of paths, and chosen any further 
modifications, you can press the 'merge' button to start the merge 
process. <br>

<br> 
Once the merge has occurred the user interface will automatically 
switch to display the obomerge utility feedback in the Process Feedback tab. <br><br> 
For an explanation of the contents of the feedback you should read the <a href="../obomerge.htm">obomerge utility user guide</a>. <br>

<br>
You may also save the feedback text to a file by using the 'save'
button. <br>
