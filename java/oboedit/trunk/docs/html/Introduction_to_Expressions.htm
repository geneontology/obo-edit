<H1>Introduction to Expressions</H1>
<P>&nbsp;OBO-Edit includes a powerful scripting language 
called OSL, the OBO Scripting Language. This language is a heavily extended 
version of the Java Expression Language (Jexl) from the Apache Commons Project 
(<A 
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jexl/index.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jexl/index.html</A>).</P>
<P>OSL extends Jexl with the following features:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>user-defined functions 
  <LI>extendable built-in functions (that may call static 
  methods) 
  <LI>variable scoping 
  <LI>break statement 
  <LI>return statement 
  <LI>for statement
  <LI>C-style comments</LI></UL>
<P>In this guide, the terms "script" and "expression" are used more or less 
interchangably, with "expression" usually referring to a shorter, single-line 
script used inside a layout or search.</P>
<H2>What Do They Do?</H2>
<P>Currently, OSL expressions can be used in 3 places:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Layouts</STRONG> - OSL expressions can appear in <A 
  href="Backtick_Expressions.htm">backtick expressions</A> inside a <A 
  href="Working_with_XML_Layouts.htm">screen layout</A>&nbsp;and control whether 
  the contents of an <FONT 
  face=Courier>&lt;if&gt;</FONT> t<IF>ag&nbsp;are displayed. 
  <LI><STRONG>Filter&nbsp;Values</STRONG> - OSL expressions can appear within <A 
  href="Backtick_Expressions.htm">backtick expressions</A> inside 
  of&nbsp;a filter value. 
  <LI><STRONG>obo2obo scripts</STRONG> - The <A href="obo2obo.htm">obo2obo</A> 
  command-line utility can run a script as part of its ontology-processing step. 
  These scripts can report information about the contents of an ontology or 
  modify the ontology before the ontology is written to disk.</LI></UL>
<P>Future versions of OBO-Edit will have many more uses for scripts.</P>
<H2>What You Need to Know to Use OSL</H2>
<P>OSL is a powerful, full-featured scripting language. OSL users should be 
comfortable programming in a complex scripting language (OSL's syntax and 
features are very similar to JavaScript). OSL scripts in OBO-Edit have direct 
access to somes of OBO-Edit's Java datamodels, so some familiarity with Java and 
the conventions of javadoc are also very useful.</P>
