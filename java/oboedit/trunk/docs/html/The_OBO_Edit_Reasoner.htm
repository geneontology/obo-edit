<H1>The OBO-Edit Reasoner</H1>
<P><!--StartFragment -->A reasoner is a piece of software 
that examines an ontology and&nbsp;infers links that have not been explicitly 
stated by a curator. The structure and relationships of the ontology encode 
knowledge. Each relationship type has specific relations, and&nbsp;a reasoner 
uses these to deduce further information about the ontology.</P>
<P>The OBO-Edit reasoner is a very simple (but relatively fast) reasoning tool 
that relies on a small set of rules to make inferences about the ontology.
See <A href="The_Reasoner_and_the_Interface.htm">The Reasoner and the
Interface</A> for instructions on how to turn the reasoner on (or off) and how it affects the OBO-Edit displays.
</P>
<P>The reasoner deduces <EM>every single implied fact</EM> in an ontology. Every 
non-redundant ontology encodes a lot of implicit information, so the reasoner 
can use a lot of memory as it makes this implicit information explicit. See <A 
href="The_Configuration_Plugin.htm">The Configuration Plugin</A> for information 
about how to increase the memory available to OBO-Edit.</P>
<H2>Reasoner Rules</H2>
<P>This section documents all the rules OBO-Edit uses for 
reasoning. Realize that all these rules interact. If an implied link is 
discovered, that implied link may be used to discover yet&nbsp;other implied links.</P>
<H3>Rule 1: Transitivity</H3>
<P>A transitive relation is one where if there is a link "A 
-transitive_relation-&gt; B" and "B -transitive_relation-&gt; C", then "A 
-transitive_relation-&gt; C". <STRONG>part_of</STRONG> is a transitive relation, 
so if "finger -<STRONG>part_of</STRONG>-&gt; hand" and "hand 
-<STRONG>part_of</STRONG>-&gt; arm", then it is implied that "finger 
-<STRONG>part_of</STRONG>-&gt; arm". Transitive 
relationships are always preserved over is_a links, so if "A 
-transitive_relation-&gt; B" and "B -<STRONG>is_a</STRONG>-&gt; C" then "A 
-transitive_relation-&gt; C".&nbsp;See <A 
href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm#transitivity">An Introduction to OBO 
Ontologies</A> for more information. </P>
<P>The OBO-Edit reasoner infers all the relationships in an ontology that are 
implied by transitivity but not explicitly stated. Consider the following simple 
ontology:</P>
<P><IMG height=94 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_ontology.gif" 
width=181 border=0></P>
<P><STRONG>is_a</STRONG> and <STRONG>part_of</STRONG> are transitive relations, 
so the reasoner will deduce the following implied links:</P>
<P><IMG height=41 hspace=0 
src="../images/reasoner_elephant_mini_implications1.gif" width=116 border=0><IMG 
height=40 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_mini_implications2.gif" 
width=88 border=0><IMG height=39 hspace=0 
src="../images/reasoner_elephant_mini_implications3.gif" width=98 border=0></P>
<H3>Rule 2: Simple Genus/Differentia Implications</H3>
<P>This is an extremely simple rule. It says that if a term has a cross product 
definition, the relationships in that definition hold true for the term itself 
at all times.</P>
<P>For example, let's say the following cross-product is defined for "cell 
development":</P>
<P><IMG height=127 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_genus_diff_rule.gif" 
width=319 border=0></P>
<P>The reasoner will determine that "cell differentiation" has an implied 
<EM>affects</EM> relationship to "cell", because of the cross product 
definition. It will also assume that "cell differentiation" has an implied 
<EM>is_a</EM> relationship to "development" because of the genus section of the 
cross product definition.</P>
<H3>Rule 3:&nbsp;Cross Product&nbsp;Definition 
Resolution</H3>
<P>This rule infers <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> links implied by 
cross product definitions. One way of understanding this is to say that some 
terms in an ontology may "match"&nbsp;some other term's&nbsp;cross product 
defintion. If a term matches another term's cross product defintion, an 
<STRONG>is_a</STRONG> link is created between the terms.</P>
<P>A term matches a cross product definition when:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<DIV>The term has an is_a relationship to the genus 
  term</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV>The term has the appropriate relationship to each 
  discriminating relation (in the example above, a matching term would have to 
  have an "affects" relationship to "cell").</DIV></LI></UL>
<P>Recall that once the reasoner is running, implied links 
can be used by reasoner rules to&nbsp;discover new implied links. Therefore, 
this reasoner rule has access to all the links that were generated by the 
transitivity rule. These extra links can lead to useful (and sometimes 
unexpected) implications from the reasoner.</P>
<H2>Evidence</H2>
<P>Every time the reasoner discovers a new link, that 
discovery is based on some supporting links in the ontology. These supporting 
links are called the <STRONG>evidence</STRONG> or <STRONG>explanation</STRONG> 
for the new implied link.</P>
<P>Link evidence consists of two parts: The rule that was 
used to discover the implied link, and the links that were used to support the 
discovery. Implied links can be used as evidence for other implied links, so the 
evidence for one link might have its own evidence.</P>
<P>Every link in an ontology has evidence, even non-implied 
links. Links that were explicitly created by a human user are explained with the 
special evidence <STRONG>GIVEN</STRONG>. This piece of evidence means that the 
link was made by a human, not&nbsp;the reasoner.</P>
<P>It is possible for a link to have more than one 
explanation. A link may be implied by transitivity, and multiple collections of 
links can be used to support that implication. The reasoner records every 
possible explanation for an implied link.</P>
<P>See <A href="The_Explanation_Plugin.htm">The Explanation 
Plugin</A> to learn how to see the evidence for implied links.</P>
<H2>Reasoner Checks</H2>
<P>The reasoner has the capability to check the ontology for 
certain kinds of problems. In the future, the reasoner will support many 
different checks, but right now the reasoner only checks for:</P>
<H3>Redundant Links<A name=redundant></A> </H3>
<P>Redundant links are links that were explicitly created by 
a human but are unncessary because that link is implied by other facts in the 
ontology. Consider this version of our elephant ontology:</P>
<P><IMG height=114 hspace=0 
src="../images/reasoner_elephant_redundant.gif" width=181 border=0></P>
<P>The link "tusk -part_of-&gt; animal" is redundant, 
because that relationship is already implied by transitivity.</P>
<P>Formally, a redundant link is any link with multiple 
explanations, one of which is <STRONG>GIVEN</STRONG>. This definition works 
because if a link has multiple explanations, the reasoner must have discovered 
at least one of them, and if one of the explanations is <STRONG>GIVEN</STRONG>, 
a human must have created the link. Therefore, a human has created a link that 
the reasoner was able to infer automatically, making the link redundant.</P>
<P>By default, redundant links are shown with a red arrow. 
It is possible to create special searches, filters and renderers for redundant 
links. See <A href="Link_Filters.htm">Link Filters</A>&nbsp;for more 
information.</P>
<H2>Reasoner Limitations</H2>
<P>The OBO-Edit reasoner is very limited at the moment. Things that it currently 
<EM>cannot</EM> do include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Take advantage of necessary/inverse_necessary info 
  <LI>Identify cycles of non-cyclic relations 
  <LI>Reason about inverse_of links 
  <LI>Reason about&nbsp;union_of links 
  <LI>Reason about symmetrical relations 
  <LI>Do cardinality checks 
  <LI>Use domain and range information 
  <LI>Make full use of sub-relations</LI></UL>
<P>These capabilities will be slowly added in future versions of 
OBO-Edit.</P>
