<h1>The Ontology Tree Editor Panel</h1>
<p>Once an ontology is loaded, there are a number of ways to view it. The Ontology Tree Editor panel is the main view 
of the classes in your ontology.</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel.png" 
border=0></p>
<p>See the "Component Toolbars" subsection of <a
href="Components.htm">Components</a> for explanations of the icons at
the top of each Ontology Tree Editor panel.
</p>
<h2>Top Level Nodes</h2>
<p>Whenever OBO-Edit loads an ontology, the Ontology Tree Editor panel always contains 
three root nodes named "Classes", "Relations", and "Obsolete":</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_roots.png" 
 border=0></p>
<p>All of the classes (aka "terms") in your ontology are listed under the 
"Classes" nodes. Relations (aka relationship types) are listed under
"Relations", and all obsolete objects (which may be classes, relations, or 
instances) will be listed under the Obsolete node.</p>
<p>These top level nodes <strong>do not represent objects in the 
ontology</strong>. They exist simply to help organize the display. You cannot 
select these top-level nodes or modify them in any way.</p>

<h2>Expanding/Collapsing Nodes</h2>
<p>The Ontology Tree Editor panel displays the ontology as a tree. Branches of the tree 
can be expanded or collapsed, so that only a part of the tree is visible at any 
one time. The expand/collapse controls look like boxes containing a plus or 
minus sign:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_collapse.png" 
 border=0></p>
<p>If the expand/collapse control is marked with a plus, that means that there are 
other branches of the tree below, and clicking on the control will cause those 
branches to become visible. If the control is marked with a minus, it means that 
child branches are already visible, and clicking on the control will cause them 
to be collapsed. If a line in the display has no expand/collapse control (like 
"podosome" in the image above), it means that there are no 
branches beneath that node.</p>

<h2>Representing Relationships</h2>
<p>In the Ontology Tree Editor panel, "child" nodes 
appear beneath their "parent" nodes. Each node in the display represents a 
relationship between two terms. Consider this small piece of the display:</p>
<p><IMG height=24 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_link.gif" width=181 
border=0></p>
<p>Here, "extracellular organelle" is beneath "organelle" and is indented to the 
right. This indicates that "extracellular organelle" is a <em>child</em> of 
organelle.</p>
<p>Each line of the display describes a relationship between a child term and 
its parents. The arrow is there as a reminder that these relationships are to be 
read from <strong>right-to-left</strong>. The <IMG height=12 hspace=0 
src="../images/is_a.gif" width=13 border=0>&nbsp;symbol means that the 
relationship type is <strong>is_a</strong>, so the example above means:</p><pre>extracellular organelle <strong>is_a</strong> organelle</pre>
<p>We understand the relationships the same way if a node has multiple 
children:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_links.png" 
 border=0></p>
<p>The highlighed section means:</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier">extracellular organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">intracellular organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">membrane-bounded organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">non-membrane-bounded organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">organelle part <strong>part_of</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">podosome <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">vesicle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">organelle <strong>is_a</strong> cellular 
  component</font></li></ul>
<h2>Relationship Types</h2>
<p>Relationship types are represented as icons that appear between a parent and 
child term:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_types.png" 
 border=0></p>

<p>A few icons for common relationship types are provided by OBO-Edit
by default. (See the <A href="Configuration_Manager.htm">Configuration
Manager</A> for information on customizing these icons.)</p>
<p>Note that root classes, root relations, and obsolete terms do not have a 
relationship type where they connect to the root display nodes. For example, 
there is no relationship type icon between "biological process" and "Classes" in 
the above example. That is because relationship types only exist between 
entities in the ontology. Since the top level nodes are simply to organize the 
display, entities in the ontology have no named relationship to them.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h1>Why does my ontology tree look flat?</h1>
<hr>
<p>Some ontologies, such as ChEBI, have relationship types that are not
transitive.
OBO-Edit can display any relationships that are specified in an OBO
file.  However, older versions of OBO-Edit were configured with a default global filter
that hid all non-transitive relationships.
If you have that filter in your OBO-Edit configuration directory from an earlier version of OBO-Edit,
the ChEBI ontology would be displayed in an unhelpful "flat" form like this:</p>

<p><img src="../images/chebi.png" width="623" height="411" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>To solve the problem, you need to bring up the Global Filters component
  ([Config] -> [Global Filters]). Then select 
"Link filters" and delete the second filter: <em>Select links where Type that have a Is Transitive.</em></p>

<p><img src="../images/is_transitive.png" width="842" height="244" border="0" alt=""></p>
<p>The ChEBI ontology should then display correctly:</p>
<p><img src="../images/chebi_fixed.png" width="430" height="328" border="0" alt=""></p>
</div>

<h2>Viewing Obsoletes</h2>
<p>Obsolete terms appear under the "Obsolete" node. 
Although obsolete terms cannot have parents or children,&nbsp;if an obsolete 
term has replacement or "consider" terms specified, they will appear underneath the 
obsolete term:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/obsolete-replacement-view.png" border=0>
</p>

<p>In this case, the view means that the obsolete term "2-nitropropane
biosynthesis" has been replaced by "2-nitropropane metabolism".  The
obsolete "26S proteasome" does not have an exact replacement, but the
term "proteasome complex" might be a valid replacement.</p>

<p>Note that "replaced by" and "consider" <em>are not real
relationship types.</em> There is no relation named "replaced by" or
"consider".  These lines appear in the Ontology Tree Editor panel as a
viewing convenience, but they do not represent real relationships in
the ontology. They merely represent assignments to the OBO&nbsp;tags
named&nbsp;"consider" and "replaced_by".</p>

<p>See <A href="Assigning_Replacement_Terms.htm">Assigning Replacement Terms</A> 
for more information about "consider" and "replaced_by".</p>

<h2>Working with Multiple Ontology Tree Editors: Global vs. Local Selection mode</h2>

<p>You can display several Ontology Tree Editor panels at once
(to learn how to add more Ontology Tree Editor panels to your
interface, see the <A href="Components.htm">Components</A> and <a
href="Perspectives.htm">Perspectives</a> sections).
If there is more than one Ontology Tree Editor panel, each panel
can be independently set to <i>global</i> or <i>local</i> selection mode.
In global selection mode, the Ontology Tree Editor will respond to external events
in other panels (for example, clicking on search results), whereas in local selection
mode it doesn't.    Each panel
that is in local selection mode may display a different section of the
ontology, and may have a different term or collection of terms
selected.
</p><p>
The selection mode can be toggled by
the globe/house icon button in the titlebar. In the titlebar shown below, the globe icon
(indicating that the panel is in global selection mode) is the fourth from the left.</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/toolbar.png" center border=0></p>
<p>
When you're in local
selection mode, you'll see the house icon instead of the globe, and
the background of the Ontology Tree Editor will turn gray.
By default, only one Ontology Tree Editor can be in global selection mode at a given time.
This behavior can be controlled in the <a href="Configuration_Manager.htm">Configuration Manager</a>.
</p>
<p>Whether in global or local selection mode, panels may be
filtered differently or may have different rendering settings. See <A
href="Working_with_Selections.htm">Working with Selections</A> for
more information.</p>
<p>However, no matter how many Ontology Tree Editor panels are on screen, each is 
displaying a different view <em>of the <strong>same</strong> ontology</em>. 
Edits that are executed on one Ontology Tree Editor panel will affect the contents of 
<strong>all</strong> Ontology Tree Editor panels.</p>

<h2>Changing the Font in the Ontology Tree Editor</h2>
<p>You can change the font used in this component via the "Font" tab
  in the <a href="Configuration_Manager.htm">Configuration
  Manager</a>.

<h2>Other Views of the Ontology</h2>

<p>The Ontology Tree Editor panel isn't the only way to view an
ontology. See <A href="Tree_Viewer.htm">The Tree Viewer</A>, <a
href="Graph_Viewer.htm">The Graph Viewer</a>, <A
href="The_GraphViz_Viewer.htm">The GraphViz Viewer</A> and <A
href="Parent_Editor.htm">The Parent_Editor</A> to learn more about
other ways to look at your ontology.</p>
