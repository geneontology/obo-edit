<h1>The Ontology Tree Editor Panel</h1>
<p>Once an ontology is loaded, there are a number of ways to view it. The ontology tree editor panel is the main view 
of the classes in your ontology.</p>
<p><IMG height=400 width=476 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel.png" 
border=0></p>
<h2>Top Level Nodes</h2>
<p>Whenever OBO-Edit loads an ontology, the ontology tree editor panel always contains 
three root nodes named "Classes", "Relations", and "Obsolete":</p>
<p><IMG height=400 width=476 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_roots.png" 
 border=0></p>
<p>All of the classes (aka "terms") in your ontology are listed beneath the 
"Classes" nodes. Relations (aka relationship types) are listed beneath 
"Relations", and all obsolete objects (which may be classes, relations, or 
instances) will be listed under the Obsolete node.</p>
<p>These top level nodes <strong>do not represent objects in the 
ontology</strong>. They exist simply to help organize the display. You cannot 
select these top-level nodes or modify them in any way.</p>

<h2>Expanding/Collapsing Nodes</h2>
<p>The ontology tree editor panel displays the ontology as a tree. Branches of the tree 
can be expanded or collapsed, so that only a part of the tree is visible at any 
one time. The expand/collapse controls look like boxes containing a plus or 
minus sign:</p>
<p><IMG height=400 width=476 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_collapse.png" 
 border=0></p>
<p>If expand/collapse control is marked with a plus, that means that there are 
other branches of the tree below, and clicking on the control will cause those 
branches to become visible. If the control is marked with a minus, it means that 
child branches are already visible, and clicking on the control will cause them 
to be collapsed. If a line in the display has no expand/collapse control (like 
"cellular component unknown" in the image above), it means that there are no 
branches beneath that node.</p>

<h2>Representing Relationships</h2>
<p>The ontology tree editor panel displays the ontology as a tree, with "child" nodes 
appearing beneath their "parent" nodes. Each node in the display represents a 
relationship between two terms. Consider this small piece of the display:</p>
<p><IMG height=24 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_link.gif" width=181 
border=0></p>
<p>Here, "extracellular organelle" is beneath "organelle" and is indented to the 
right. This indicates that "extracellular organelle" is a <em>child</em> of 
organelle.</p>
<p>Each line of the display describes a relationship between a child term and 
its parents. The arrow is there as a reminder that these relationships are to be 
read from <strong>right-to-left</strong>. The <IMG height=12 hspace=0 
src="../images/is_a.gif" width=13 border=0>&nbsp;symbol means that the 
relationship type is <strong>is_a</strong>, so the example above means:</p><pre>extracellular organelle <strong>is_a</strong> organelle</pre>
<p>We understand the relationships the same way if a node has multiple 
children:</p>
<p><IMG height=400 width=476 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_links.png" 
 border=0></p>
<p>The highlighed section means:</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier">extracellular organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">intracellular organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">membrane-bound organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">non-membrane-bound organelle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">organelle part <strong>part_of</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">podosome <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">vesicle <strong>is_a</strong> 
  organelle</font>
  <li><font face="Courier">organelle <strong>is_a</strong> cellular 
  component</font></li></ul>
<h2>Relationship Types</h2>
<p>Relationship types are represented as icons that appear between a parent and 
child term:</p>
<p><IMG height=400 width=476 hspace=0 src="../images/term_editor_panel_types.png" 
 border=0></p>
<p>A few icons for common relationship types are provided by 
OBO-Edit by default. (See <A href="Configuration.htm">The 
Configuration Manager</A> for information on customizing these icons.)</p>
<p>Note that root classes, root relations, and obsolete terms do not have a 
relationship type where they connect to the root display nodes. For example, 
there is no relationship type icon between "biological process" and "Classes" in 
the above example. That is because relationship types only exist between 
entities in the ontology. Since the top level nodes are simply to organize the 
display, entities in the ontology have no named relationship to them.</p>
<h2>Viewing Obsoletes</h2>
<p>Obsolete terms appear under the "Obsolete" node. 
Although obsolete terms cannot have parents or children,&nbsp;if an obsolete 
term has replacement or "consider" terms specified, they will appear underneath the 
obsolete term:</p>
<p><IMG height=79 hspace=0 
src="../images/obsolete_replacement_view.gif" width=332 border=0>            
 </p>
<p>In this case, the view means that the obsolete term 
"2-nitropropane biosynthesis" has been replaced by "2-nitropropane metabolism". 
The obsolete "26S proteasome" does not have an exact replacement, but the term "proteasome complex" might be a 
valid replacement.</p>
<p>Note that "replaced by" and "consider" <em>are not real 
relationship types.</em> There is no relation named "replaced by" or "consider". 
These lines appear in the ontology tree editor panel as a viewing convenience, but they 
do not represent real relationships in the ontology. They merely represent assignments to the OBO&nbsp;tags named&nbsp;"consider" 
and "replaced_by".</p>
<p>See <A href="Assigning_Replacement_Terms.htm">Assigning Replacement Terms</A> 
for more information about "consider" and "replaced_by".</p>
<h2>Working with Multiple Ontology Tree Editors</h2>
<p>There can be several ontology tree editor panels on screen at once (to learn how to 
add more ontology tree editor panels to your interface, see the <A href="Components.htm">Components</A> and <a href="Perspectives.htm">Perspectives</a> sections).</p>

<p>If there is more than one ontology tree editor panel, each panel can be
independently set to global or local selection mode. Any panel in
local selection mode may display a different section of the ontology,
and may have a different collection of terms selected. Whether in
global or local selection mode, panels may be filtered differently or
may have different rendering settings. See <A
href="Working_with_Selections.htm">Working with Selections</A> for
more information.</p>

<p>However, no matter how many ontology tree editor panels are on screen, each is 
displaying a different view <em>of the <strong>same</strong> ontology</em>. 
Edits that are executed on one ontology tree editor panel will affect the contents of 
<strong>all</strong> ontology tree editor panels.</p>

<p>See the "Component Toolbars" subsection of <a
href="Components.htm">Components</a> for explanations of the icons at
the top of each ontology tree editor panel.

<h2>Other Views of the Ontology</h2>
<p>The ontology tree editor panel isn't the only way to view an 
ontology. See <A href="The_DAG_Viewer.htm">The DAG Viewer</A>, <A 
href="The_Graph_Viewer_Plugin.htm">The Graph Viewer Plugin</A> and <A 
href="Parent_Editor.htm">The Parent_Editor</A>              
         to 
learn more about other ways to look at your ontology.</p>
