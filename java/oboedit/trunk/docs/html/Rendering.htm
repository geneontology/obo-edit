<H1>Rendering</H1>
<P>Rendering allows a user to specify special colors, fonts, 
and other visual effects to terms in a ontology editor panel that match a particular 
filter.</P>

<p>Renderers can be applied in any Ontology Tree Editor or Graph
Editor panel, and each panel can have different renderers.</p>

<p> To create a new renderer, click the wrench icon on the panel where
you want the rendering effects to appear. Choose the "Term Renderers"
or "Link Renderers" tab. Click the <img src="../images/plus.png"
alt="" border=0> button to bring up a filter panel, then specify the
filter criteria or load a saved filter (see <a
href="Building_a_Filter.htm">Building Filters</a> for how to do
this). </p>
<P>Next, specify one or more visual effects to apply to matching
terms. To apply the new renderer to the panel, click the check mark to
complete panel configuration.</P>

<P> With the settings shown in the screenshot below, the ontology
editor panel will draw any term whose name contains "activity" in
red:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/render_editor_panel.png" border=0></P>
<P>A ontology editor panel can have any number of renderers at 
the same time.</P>
<H2>Specifying Renderer Options</H2>
<P>Renderers can apply several different visual effects to matching
terms. The available effects are different for term filters and link
filters.</P>
<P>In general, to apply a visual effect, select the checkbox 
next to it. If a visual effect is configurable, a configuration control will 
appear next to the checkbox once it is selected. A renderer may apply several 
visual effects to a matching term.</P>
<H3>Term Renderer Effects</H3>

<P>Term renderer effects change the way a term name is displayed in
the ontology editor panel. The following renderer effects are
available for term filters:</P>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Foreground Color</strong> - The "Foreground Color" 
  effect changes the color of the text displaying terms that match the filter. If the "Foreground Color" 
  checkbox is checked, a set of controls will appear next to the checkbox, allowing you to configure the 
  color that will be applied to matching terms. 

  <ul>

    <!-- if blending is fixed for release, include this and change the 'multiple renderers' section      <li><strong>Do blending</strong> - If this box is checked, colors will be blended if a term matches more than one color renderer. -->

    <li><strong>Simple coloring</strong> - This is the most commonly
    used color renderer. If the "Simple coloring" box is checked,
    matching terms will appear in the selected color. To choose a
    different color, click the "CHANGE" button. A color selection
    window will appear where you can choose a different color for
    matching terms.

    <li><strong>Heat map coloring</strong> - Some OBO-Edit search
    criteria are numeric rather than text based (e.g. Parent
    Count). You can use the configurable "Heat map coloring" to create
    a graduated coloring based on numeric search criteria. If the
    "Heat map coloring" box is checked, additional controls appear
    that allow you to configure the color gradient.

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Min color, Max color, and Blank color</strong> - The
      "Min color" and "Max color" buttons allow you to select the
      colors for the minimum and maximum ends of the gradient,
      respectively; the "Blank color" button lets you specify the
      color to use for missing values. Each button makes the color
      selection panel appear.

      <li><strong>Criterion</strong> - This selector lets you choose
      which numeric criterion to use to generate the heat map. In
      OBO-Edit 2.0, the available options are Parent Count and ISA
      Parent Count (more may be added in future versions of OBO-Edit).

      <li><strong>Minimum Value and Maximum Value</strong> - These
      selectors let you specify the minimum and maximum values for the
      gradient. The "&lt;auto-calculate&gt;" option automatically
      determines the color depending on which matching terms are
      selected; "&lt;enter constant&gt;" lets you enter your own
      maximum and minimum values; "Max parent count" and "Min parent
      count" use the maximum and minimum values in the ontology.

    </ul>

  </ul>

  <li><strong>Background Color</strong> - The "Background Color"
  effect changes the background color of terms that match the
  filter. If the "Background Color" checkbox is checked, a set of
  controls will appear next to the checkbox to configure the
  background color that will be applied to matching terms. The color
  controls work the same way as for "Foreground Color", described
  above.

  <li><strong>Font Face</strong> - The "Font Face" effect changes the
  typeface of terms that match the filter. If the "Font Face" checkbox
  is checked, a dropdown list of available fonts will appear next to
  the checkbox. Select the font you would like to apply to matching
  terms.

  <li><strong>Font Size</strong> - The "Font Size" effect changes the
  type size of terms that match the filter. If the "Font Size"
  checkbox is checked, a text field with arrows appears next to the
  checkbox. Type the desired text size into the text field or use the
  arrows to increment the size up or down.

  <li><strong>Bold</strong> - The "Bold" effect makes matching terms
  appear in a bold typeface. There are no special configuration
  controls for this effect.

  <li><strong>Italic</strong> - The "Italic" effect makes matching
  terms appear in a italic typeface. There are no special
  configuration controls for this effect.

  <li><strong>Underline</strong> - The "Underline" effect makes
  matching terms appear undelined. There are no special configuration
  controls for this effect.
  <li><strong>Strikeout</strong> - The "Strikeout" effect makes
  matching terms appear struck out, i.e. with a horizontal line
  through the type. There are no special configuration controls for
  this effect.

  <li><strong>HTML Code</strong> - This checkbox allows you to specify
  OBO-Edit renderers in HTML code. See <a
  href="HTML_Rendering.htm">HTML Rendering</a> for details.

</ul>




<H3>Link Renderer Effects</H3>
<P>Link renderer effects change the way the arrow between a 
term and its parent (<IMG height=14 hspace=0 src="../images/link_arrow.gif" 
width=80 border=0>) is displayed in the ontology editor panel. The following 
renderer effects are available:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Foreground Color</STRONG> - The "Foreground Color"
  effect changes the color of the link arrow for links that match the
  filter. If the "Foreground Color" checkbox is checked, color
  selection controls will appear next to the checkbox. See Term
  Renderer Effects above for a description of the color selection
  controls.
  <LI><STRONG>Line Width</STRONG> - The "Line Width" effect changes
  the thickness of the link arrow line. If the "Line Width" checkbox
  is checked, a text field with arrows will appear next to the
  checkbox. Type the desired line width (in pixels) into the text
  field or use the arrows to increment the size up or down.
  <LI><STRONG>Line Type</STRONG> - The "Line Type" effect changes the
  way the link arrow line is drawn. If the "Line Type" checkbox is
  checked, a dropdown box will appear next to the checkbox showing the
  available line types. The available options are "SOLID-LINE",
  "DASHED_LINE", and "ZIGZAG_LINE".
</UL>

<!-- old version; use if blending won't be fixed for release -->
<H2>Multiple Renderers at Once</H2>
<P>Any number of renderers may be applied to a ontology editor panel at once. If a 
term matches multiple renderers, OBO-Edit will try to merge the renderer effects 
to display as much information as possible.</P>
<P>OBO-Edit can merge renderer effects of different types. If one renderer wants 
to make a term red, and another wants to make a term bold, OBO-Edit will show 
the term in red and in bold. But OBO-Edit cannot merge effects of the same type. 
If one renderer wants to make a term red and another wants to make the term 
blue, OBO-Edit will only display a single color.</P>
<P>When two renderers specify two different values for the same effect, OBO-Edit 
chooses the value from the most recently added renderer.</P>
<P>Therefore, if you plan to use several renderers at once, it is usually a good 
idea to use a different type of renderer effect for each renderer. That way it 
is easy to tell if a term matches multiple renderers.</P>

<H2>Removing Renderers</H2>

<p>To remove a renderer, click the wrench icon to open the
configuration screen, and choose the "Term Renderers" or "Link
Renderers" tab. Select the renderer you want to remove, and click
the <img src="../images/minus.png" alt="" border=0> button to remove
it. Click the check mark to finish and exit configuration.</p>
