		<p>The term in focus can be linked to the other panels in OBO-Edit by selecting the '<i>link this selection with main selection</i>' button if required. Otherwise the cross-product terms in the table can be browsed independently of what is being displayed in the other panels. Upon selection of a term by double clicking on it, an editing panel will appear within the table. To exit this panel, click on the table.</p>
