<h1>The OWL Adapter</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Reads 
and writes files in the OWL format. The adapter converts OWL to OBO and OBO to OWL using the 
<A href="http://code.google.com/p/oboformat/">oboformat library</A>. 
<h2>Operation</h2>
<h3>Basic Operation</h3>
<p>The OWL adapter's basic mode is similar to the interface described 
in&nbsp;<A href="The_Basic_Flat_File_Interface.htm">The Basic Flat File 
Interface</A>.</p>
<h3>Advanced Operation</h3>
<h4>Loading</h4>
<p>To the right of the Data adapter pulldown menu, there's a button that (when
  you're in Basic mode) says "Advanced".
  When the "Advanced" button is pressed, the load dialog 
changes to look like this:</p>
<p>This interface allows fine control over which files are loaded. The list to 
the left contains all the files to be loaded by the OWL Adapter.</p>
<p>To edit a filename, click the filename to select it. It will
be loaded into a text box to the right:</p>
<p>To change the path, type a new path into the text box, or select another file
from your computer by clicking the "Browse..." button.</p>
<p>To add a new file path, press the "Add" button. A new path will appear with 
the path set to "&lt;new path&gt;". Edit the path as described above.</p>
<p>To delete a path, select it from the list and press the "Del" button.</p>
<p>The "Allow dangling references" box enables the OWL Adapter to load converted  
ontologies that contain dangling references after the conversion from OWL.
The behavior for dangling reference is the same as for the <A href="The_OBO_Adapter.htm">OBO Adapter</A>.</p>

<h4>Saving</h4>
<p>Saving in "Basic" mode is straightforward. The Adapter writes a temporary OBO file and 
converts it to OWL. Both, simple and advanced mode, do not support multiple output files or profiles.</p>
<p>One know bug (on MacOSX 10.6) is that the file dialog sometimes removes the suffix of the output File. 
Please check that suffix is properly appended to the write path.</p>
