<h1>Filtering</h1>
<p>Filters can be used to hide certain terms and/or links in an
Ontology Tree Editor panel or a Graph Editor panel. When a filter is
placed on a panel, only matching terms and links are shown.</p>

<p>To apply a filter to a panel, click the wrench icon on the panel
that you want to filter. Choose the "Term Filters" or "Link Filters"
tab. Click the "Filter Terms" or "Filter Links" button to bring up a
filter panel, then specify the filter criteria or load a saved filter
(see <a href="Building_a_Filter.htm">Building Filters</a> for how to
do this) using the standard search panel: </p>

<p>To apply the new filter to the panel, click the check mark to
complete panel configuration. The filter shown above will show terms
that have "kinase" in the name or a synonym, and hide others.</P>

<h2>Term Filters vs. Link Filters</h2>
<p>If a term filter is used to filter an ontology editor panel, only terms that match 
the filter will be shown. The only links that will be shown are links between 
matching terms.</p>
<p>If a link filter is used to filter an ontology editor panel, only links that match 
the filter will be shown. Terms will be shown if they are the child term of a 
matching link.</p>
<p>If <strong>both</strong> a link filter and term filter are used to filter a 
ontology editor panel, only terms that match the term filter will be shown, and 
links that match the link filter will be shown. If a link matches the link 
filter, but the child term of that link does not match the term filter, the link 
will not be shown. This kind of filtering gives you the greatest degree of 
control of filtering behavior.</p>

<p>Note that the filtering behavior is quite different depending on
whether you are filtering with a term filter, a link filter, or
both. The kind of filter that is applied depends on whether you use
the "Term filters" or "Link filters" configuration tab. Make sure that
you have selected the filtering mode you want before filtering to
avoid unexpected behavior.</p>

<h2>Removing Filters</h2>
<p>To remove a filter, click the wrench icon to open the configuration
screen, and choose the "Term Filters" or "Link Filters" tab. You can
then alter the filter criteria, or simply uncheck the "Filter Terms"
or "Filter Links" button to remove filters from the panel. Click the
check mark to finish and exit configuration.</p>
