<h1>Filtering</h1>
<p>Filters can be used to hide certain terms and/or links 
in an ontology editor panel. When a filter is placed on an ontology editor panel, only 
matching terms and links are shown.</p>
<p>Ontologies can be filtered using the standard search panel: </p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/filter_term_standard.png" 
border=0>
<p>An ontology editor panel can be filtered by designing a 
filter in the filter designer on the left, and pressing the "Filter" button. The 
primary ontology editor panel will be filtered. If the primary ontology editor panel is 
already filtered and a new filter is applied, the old filter will be replaced 
with the new filter.</p>
<p>To apply a filter to an ontology editor panel other than the primary ontology editor 
panel, drag and drop the filter button onto the desired ontology editor panel. The 
filter will be applied to the target panel.</p>
<h2>Term Filters vs. Link Filters</h2>
<p>If a term filter is used to filter an ontology editor panel, only terms that match 
the filter will be shown. The only links that will be shown are links between 
matching terms.</p>
<p>If a link filter is used to filter an ontology editor panel, only links that match 
the filter will be shown. Terms will be shown if they are the child term of a 
matching link.</p>
<p>If <strong>both</strong> a link filter and term filter are used to filter a 
ontology editor panel, only terms that match the term filter will be shown, and 
links that match the link filter will be shown. If a link matches the link 
filter, but the child term of that link does not match the term filter, the link 
will not be shown. This kind of filtering gives you the greatest degree of 
control of filtering behavior.</p>
<p>Note that the filtering behavior is quite different depending on whether you 
are filtering with a term filter, a link filter, or both. The kind of filter 
that is applied depends on whether "Term filtering" and "Link filtering" are 
enabled in the "Advanced" tab. Make sure that you have selected the filtering 
mode you want before filtering to avoid unexpected behavior.</p>
<h2>Removing Filters</h2>
<p>To remove a filter, click your right mouse button in the Ontology Tree
  Editor panel to pop up a menu.
Choose "Remove link filter", "Remove term filter", or "Remove all filters and renderers" from the popup
  menu. </p>
