<H1>How Do I Not Search Obsoletes?</H1>
<p>By default, OBO-Edit includes obsolete terms in search results (or
autocomplete suggestions). Obsolete terms that match your query are included in the result list 
but shown in red and crossed out.
</p><p>
You can change this behavior and make OE ignore obsoletes in searches by checking the checkbox for
"Exclude obsolete terms from search results" on the Behavior tab of the
the <a href="Configuration_manager.htm">Configuration Manager</a>, and restarting
OBO-Edit. Note that if you choose this setting, searches will be slower
(because OE has to check all the search results to see if they are obsolete).</p>
