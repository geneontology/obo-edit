<h1>Cross Products in the Text Editor</h1>
<p> The <A href="Text_Editing.htm">text 
editor</A> contains a tab called "Cross Products":</p>
<p><IMG height=179 hspace=0 
src="../images/cross_product_tab.gif" width=490 border=0></p>
<p>This tab assumes that your cross products conform to the 
genus/differentia method of designating cross products. If you are using 
another, unrecommended method (ie creating random <A 
href="Cross_Products_By_Hand.htm">cross products by hand</A>          
             ),&nbsp;this panel 
may behave in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>The genus term is listed at the top. Differentia terms are listed in the 
"Discriminating Relations" section. Each line of this section represents a 
relationship to a term. The drop down box contains the relationship type, and 
the button immediately to the right contains the target (parent) term of this 
relationship.</p>
<p>To the right of each button that contains a term is a 
button marked with a blue circle. Clicking this button causes the term to be 
selected in the ontology editor panel. These buttons are&nbsp;for use 
while&nbsp;browsing, not editing. Clicking one of these buttons will usually 
cause a new term to be loaded into the text editor, so you will lose any pending changes to 
the cross product definition if one of these buttons is clicked.</p>
<P>Remember, this component (like all components within the <A 
href="Text_Editing.htm">text editor</A>) affects the&nbsp;<EM><A href="Working_with_Selections.htm#subselection">current 
sub-selection</A> 
</EM>.&nbsp;The genus and differentia information you enter 
will be assigned to the current term. No new terms will be created. (To create a 
new term that is a cross product of two or more existing terms, <A 
href="Adding_New_Terms.htm">create a new term</A> first, and then build your 
cross product definition). </P>
<h2>Assigning a Genus Term</h2>
<p>Drag the new genus term onto the button labeled "&lt;drop a genus term&gt;". The text on the 
button will change to the name of the new genus term.</p>
<p>To assign NO genus term, click the genus term button. The current genus term 
will be removed.</p>
<P>It is possible to create a valid cross-product with no genus term in 
OBO-Edit. It is <STRONG>not recommended</STRONG>.</P>
<h2>Assigning Differentia Terms</h2>
<p>Drop the new differentia term onto the button&nbsp;labelled "drag new terms 
here". A popup menu will appear&nbsp;containing&nbsp;a list of 
all&nbsp;available relationship types in the current ontology. Choose an option 
from the menu to assign a type to your new relationship.</p>
<p>To entirely remove a differentia term, click the garbage can button next to 
the term.</p>
<H2>Committing Changes</H2>
<p> The cross product tab is located inside the <A href="Text_Editing.htm">text 
editor</A>.&nbsp;Therefore, you must click 
the "Commit" button to make your changes permanent. Otherwise, they will be lost 
when you click a new term.</p>
<P>Once changes are committed, OBO-Edit will create the hidden links that record 
your new cross product. If <A href="The_OBO_Edit_Reasoner.htm">the reasoner</A> 
is running, OBO-Edit will try to create inferred <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> links 
based on your new cross-product definition.</P>
