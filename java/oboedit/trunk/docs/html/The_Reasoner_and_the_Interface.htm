<H1>The Reasoner and the Interface</H1>
<P>
You can turn on the reasoner by showing the Reasoner Manager ([View] -> [Show]
-> [Reasoner] -> [Reasoner Manager]) and checking the "Use reasoner" checkbox.
Once you check the checkbox, you can get rid of the Reasoner Manager panel
and the reasoner will stay on.  
You can always bring up a new Reasoner Manager
panel if you want to turn off the reasoner.
</P><P>
When the reasoner is turned on, the titlebar of the OBO-Edit window says
  "(REASONER ON)" as a visual reminder.  The reasoner causes some
operations in OBO-Edit to take longer, so you may want to turn it off if you
don't need it.
</P><P>
The reasoner changes the way the 
ontology is displayed in the ontology editor panel. 
Some of the implied links 
discovered by the reasoner may be shown in the ontology editor panel. By default, 
these implied links are displayed with a wavy blue arrow:</P>
<P><IMG height=39 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_implied_arrow.gif" width=181 
border=0></P>
<H2>Trimming<A name=trimming></A></H2>
<P>Not all implied links are shown in the ontology editor panel, because doing so 
would quickly make the interface unmanagable. Consider our elephant ontology 
once more:</P>
<P><IMG height=94 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_ontology.gif" 
width=181 border=0></P>
<P>If every single implied link were shown, we would see:</P>
<P><IMG height=171 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_notrimming.gif" 
width=185 border=0></P>
<P>It's easy to imagine how confusing this would get with an ontology of any 
complexity.</P>
<P>To reduce this complexity, OBO-Edit <STRONG>trims</STRONG> the ontology 
before displaying it. Trimming&nbsp;hides links that would unhelpfully clutter 
the display. The reasoner still knows about these links, but they are not shown 
to the user.</P>
<P>A link <STRONG>L</STRONG> is trimmed if it satisfies either of the following 
conditions:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>All evidence for&nbsp;<STRONG>L</STRONG> is based on the transitivity rule 
  <LI><STRONG>L</STRONG>'s child term has any grandparent link with the same 
  relationship type and parent term as <STRONG>L</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>There is one exception: user-created links are never 
trimmed. This means that redundant links are always visible, because all redundant links are 
user-created.</P>
