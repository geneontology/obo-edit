<H1>The Reasoner and the Interface</H1>
<P><a href-"The_OBO_Edit_Reasoner">(This page discusses what a reasoner
    is.)</a>
</p><p>
You can turn on the reasoner in OBO-Edit by showing the Reasoner Manager ([View] -> [Show]
-> [Reasoner] -> [Reasoner Manager]) and selecting a reasoner from the
pulldown list.  (Once you make your choice, you can get rid of the Reasoner Manager panel
and the reasoner selection will stay as you left it.)
<p>OBO-Edit offers a choice of reasoners.  The current options are
  ForwardChainingReasoner and LinkPileReasoner.  ForwardChainingReasoner,
  which was the default reasoner in OBO-Edit before March 2008, is faster but
  not as complete, and will be phased out.  LinkPileReasoner is currently
  very slow, but more complete.
</P><P>
When one of the reasoners is turned on, the titlebar of the OBO-Edit window says
  "(REASONER ON)" as a visual reminder.  The reasoner causes some
operations in OBO-Edit to take longer, so you may want to turn it off if you
don't need it.
</P><P>
The reasoner changes the way the 
ontology is displayed in the ontology editor panel. 
Some of the implied links 
discovered by the reasoner may be shown in the ontology editor panel. By default, 
these implied links are displayed with a wavy blue arrow:</P>
<P><IMG height=39 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_implied_arrow.gif" width=181 
border=0></P>
<H2>Trimming<A name=trimming></A></H2>
<P>Not all implied links are shown in the ontology editor panel, because doing so 
would quickly make the interface unmanagable. Consider our elephant ontology 
once more:</P>
<P><IMG height=94 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_ontology.gif" 
width=181 border=0></P>
<P>If every single implied link were shown, we would see:</P>
<P><IMG height=171 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_notrimming.gif" 
width=185 border=0></P>
<P>It's easy to imagine how confusing this would get with an ontology of any 
complexity.</P>
<P>To reduce this complexity, OBO-Edit <STRONG>trims</STRONG> the ontology 
before displaying it. Trimming&nbsp;hides links that would unhelpfully clutter 
the display. The reasoner still knows about these links, but they are not shown 
to the user.</P>
<P>A link <STRONG>L</STRONG> is trimmed if it satisfies either of the following 
conditions:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>All evidence for&nbsp;<STRONG>L</STRONG> is based on the transitivity rule 
  <LI><STRONG>L</STRONG>'s child term has any grandparent link with the same 
  relationship type and parent term as <STRONG>L</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>There is one exception: user-created links are never 
trimmed. This means that redundant links are always visible, because all redundant links are 
user-created.</P>
