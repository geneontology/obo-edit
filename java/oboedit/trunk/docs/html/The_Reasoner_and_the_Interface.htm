<H1>The Reasoner and the Interface</H1>
<P><a href-"The_OBO_Edit_Reasoner">(The OBO-Edit Reasoner page discusses what a reasoner
    is.)</a>
</p><p>
<h2>The Reasoner Manager</h2>
The reasoner is activated and deactivated via the Reasoner Manager.
You can turn on the reasoner in OBO-Edit by showing the Reasoner Manager ([Reasoner] -> [Reasoner Manager]) and selecting a reasoner from the
pulldown list.  Once you make your choice, you can get rid of the Reasoner Manager panel
However, because the
reasoner uses so much memory, it is generally a good idea to turn it on only
when you really need it, and turn it off when you're done.  Be sure to save your work
<b>before</b> you turn on the reasoner, in case OBO-Edit runs out of memory
and dies.
</p>
<p>Like most OBO-Edit components, the Reasoner Manager remembers its state when OBO-Edit is exited. This 
means that if the reasoner is on when you exit OBO-Edit, 
it will be on the next time you start OBO-Edit.  The entire application runs
  more slowly when the reasoner is running, so usually it makes sense to turn
  off the reasoner before you exit OBO-Edit (you can always turn it back on
  next time if you need it).
  </p><p>
When the reasoner is turned on, the titlebar of the OBO-Edit window says
  "(REASONER ON)" as a visual reminder.</p>
<p>
<H2>Implied Links<A name=implied_links></A></H2>
The reasoner changes the way the 
ontology is displayed in the ontology editor panel. 
Some of the implied links 
discovered by the reasoner may be shown in the ontology editor panel. By default, 
these implied links are displayed with a wavy blue arrow:</P>
<P><IMG height=39 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_implied_arrow.gif" width=181 
border=0></P>
<H2>Trimming<A name=trimming></A></H2>
<P>Not all implied links are shown in the ontology editor panel, because doing so 
would quickly make the interface unmanagable. Consider our elephant ontology 
once more:</P>
<P><IMG height=94 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_ontology.gif" 
width=181 border=0></P>
<P>If every single implied link were shown, we would see:</P>
<P><IMG height=171 hspace=0 src="../images/reasoner_elephant_notrimming.gif" 
width=185 border=0></P>
<P>It's easy to imagine how confusing this would get with an ontology of any 
complexity.</P>
<P>To reduce this complexity, OBO-Edit <STRONG>trims</STRONG> the ontology 
before displaying it. Trimming&nbsp;hides links that would unhelpfully clutter 
the display. The reasoner still knows about these links, but they are not shown 
to the user.</P>
<P>A link <STRONG>L</STRONG> is trimmed if it satisfies either of the following 
conditions:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>All evidence for&nbsp;<STRONG>L</STRONG> is based on the transitivity rule 
  <LI><STRONG>L</STRONG>'s child term has any grandparent link with the same 
  relationship type and parent term as <STRONG>L</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>There is one exception: user-created links are never 
trimmed. This means that redundant links are always visible, because all redundant links are 
user-created.</P>
