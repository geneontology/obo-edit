<H1>User Defined Checks</H1>

<P>User-defined checks are checks that a user
creates. Each <ahref="User_Defined_Checks.htm">user-defined check</a>
is associated with a term filter.  If the filter matches any term in
the ontology, the check fails and an error is reported to the
verification system.</p>
<p>To create a user-defined filter, click the "Add check" 
button. When the "Add Check" button is clicked, the User Check Editor 
appears:</p>
<p><IMG  hspace=0 
src="../images/verification_plugin_user_filter.png" border=0></p>
<p>The "Check name" field contains the name of the 
user-defined check.</p>
<p>Below the "Check name" field is a filter editor. This 
editor contains the filter that will be used to determine whether a term passes 
or fails this check. The filter should be designed so that any term that matches 
this filter fails the check.</p>
<p>Beneath this is the "Message suffix" text field. This 
field contains the ending of the error message that will be generated for terms 
that fail this check. The error message has the form "Term &lt;term name&gt; 
&lt;message suffix&gt;".</p>
<p>The final control is the "Is fatal" checkbox. If this box 
is selected, errors generated by this check are treated as fatal errors. An 
ontology that generates fatal errors when checked cannot be saved until the 
errors are corrected. If this box is not selected, error messages are treated as 
non-fatal warnings.</p>
<p>Once the check is configured, save the new configuration by clicking 
"Ok".</p>


<h2>Examples of User-defined Checks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is_a complete Check </strong></li>
<li><strong>Namespace Check</strong>
</ul>

<h2>is_a complete Check</h2>

<p>To make a warning appear if a term does not have an is_a path to the root (is_a complete rule), the user should create a
 new check like this:</p>

<h2>Namespace Check</h2>

<p>The user might want to check whether all terms have the correct namespace setting.
It is possible to create a user-defined Namespace Check to give a warning if a term has the wrong namespace. For example, in the Gene Ontology, only the relations should have 'gene_ontology' as the namespace. This check warns if any classes have the namespace 'gene_ontology</p>
