<P>The Destroy operation permanently removes a term from 
the ontology. When a term is destroyed, it is gone forever. It does not appear in the obsolete list.</P>
<P>To destroy a term, first make sure that it has at most 
one parent relationship (if it has more, first delete those other relationships). Then, select the 
term, and choose "Destroy" from the right-click or edit menu. A warning message will 
appear:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/destroy-warning.png"
border=0></P>
<P>Choose "Yes" to destroy the term, or "No" to cancel.</P>
<P>The Destroy operation can also be used to&nbsp;destroy a root terms and 
obsolete terms. To&nbsp;destroy a root or obsolete term, select the term, and 
choose "Destroy" from the right-click or edit menu. Choose "Yes" when the 
warning message appears to destroy the term.</P>

<h1>Destroying is Dangerous!</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The destroy operation should be used very, very 
sparingly. When a term is destroyed, the term's id can (and probably will) be 
re-used the next time a new term is created. The absolutely central assumption 
of all OBO ontologies is that each id refers to a unique entity. If multiple 
versions of an ontology use the same id for different entities, your ontology 
will be confusing to users and indecipherable to any 
software that tracks an ontology from version to version.
</p>
<P>Therefore, the only time that destroy should be used is when a term is added 
and then immediately removed. Ontologies that are publicly available should only 
destroy terms that have never been included in a public release of the ontology. 
If a bad term makes it into a published version of an ontology, that term should 
be made obsolete, not destroyed, so that the id number will not be 
reused.</P>
