<h1>Getting OBO-Edit Started</h1>
OBO-Edit is a Java application, so you will need to have Java on your computer.
Most new computers come with some version of Java already installed. 

<div class="sidebar">
<h1>What version of Java do I have?</h1>
<hr>
<p>To figure out which version of Java you have, open up a command 
prompt, or console, or terminal, or whatever you use on your platform to type 
commands onto a command-line. Then type:</p>
<br>
<code><b>java -version</b></code> 
<p>and press enter. You should get a response like:</p>
<br>
<code><b>java version "1.5.0_06"<br>
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard 
Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)<br>
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, 
mixed mode, sharing)</b></code>
<p>The very first line tells you which version of Java is installed.  Make sure the version
number is 1.5.something or 1.6.something.</p>
<p>If you get a response like:</p>
<br>
<code><b>'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</b></code>
<p>or</p>
<br>
<code><b>bash: java: command not found</b></code>
<p>check that you typed a space after "java" and before 
"-version". If you entered the command correctly but still do not get a response 
indicating a specific version of Java, then Java is not installed, and you need to follow the installation instructions below.</p>
</div>

<h2>1) Install Java 1.5 or higher</h2>
<p>On Macs, the latest version of Java can be installed automatically by doing a system software 
update. On any other platform, download the appropriate Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) binary from <a 
href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp">Sun</a> (the fourth
"Download" link on the page).
<h2>2) Get OBO-Edit</h2>
<p>Download the latest version of OBO-Edit from our SourceForge project 
at&nbsp;<a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geneontology">http://sourceforge.net/projects/geneontology</a></p>
<p>There will be several downloads to choose from (Windows, Mac, Linux/Unix).
<h2>3) Install and Launch OBO-Edit</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Run the installer program 
  and follow the onscreen prompts. Icons for running/uninstalling 
  the program will be created on your start menu (or desktop).  On Macs, if
  you want an OBO-Edit icon in your Dock, let the installer create a desktop
  icon and then drag it into your Dock.
  <li>If you prefer to launch OBO-Edit from the shell (on Unix or Mac), you
  can use the oe-command-line script.  You can make it automatically load an
  OBO-format file by giving the filename as the command-line argument:<br>
  <code>/Applications/OBO-Edit2/oe-command-line /blahblahblah/foo.obo</code>
</li></ul>
<div class="sidebar">
<h1>Stale files in your configuration directory</h1>
<hr>
<p>If you had already installed a previous version of OBO-Edit2, your
configuration directory 
may contain stale configuration files that clash with
the new version, which can cause problems when you try to run the new OBO-Edit2.  For best results, remove your configuration directory before
launching the new OBO-Edit2.
You can find the name of the directory by opening the <a href="Configuration_Manager.htm">Configuration
    Manager</a>.
</p>
</div>
<h2>5) Open an ontology</h2>
<p>Go to the "File" menu and choose "Load Ontologies..." (shortcut is command-O). A box will appear that looks like 
this...</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/load_with_default.png" center border=0></p>
<p>The ontology loader should show you the name of a sample ontology; just click "Ok" to load it.
</p><p>
You can download other ontologies from the Open Biological Ontologies site at <a 
href="http://obo.sourceforge.net/">http://obo.sourceforge.net/</a>
