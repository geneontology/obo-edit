<h1>Getting OBO-Edit Started</h1>
OBO-Edit is a Java application, so you will need to have Java on your computer.
Most new computers come with some version of Java already installed. 

<div class="sidebar">
<h1>What version of Java do I have?</h1>
<hr>
<p>To figure out which version of Java you have, open up a command 
prompt, or console, or terminal, or whatever you use on your platform to type 
commands onto a command-line. Then type:</p>
<br>
<code><b>java -version</b></code> 
<p>and press enter. You should get a response like:</p>
<br>
<code><b>java version "1.5.0_06"<br>
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard 
Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)<br>
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, 
mixed mode, sharing)</b></code>
<p>The very first line tells you which version of Java is installed.  Make sure the version
number is 1.5.something or 1.6.something.</p>
<p>If you get a response like:</p>
<br>
<code><b>'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</b></code>
<p>or</p>
<br>
<code><b>bash: java: command not found</b></code>
<p>check that you typed a space after "java" and before 
"-version". If you entered the command correctly but still do not get a response 
indicating a specific version of Java, then Java is not installed, and you need to follow the installation instructions below.</p>
</div>

<h2>1) Install Java 1.5 or higher</h2>
<p>On Macs, the latest version of Java can be installed automatically by doing a system software 
update. On any other platform, download the appropriate Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) binary from <a 
href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp">Sun</a> (the fourth
"Download" link on the page).
<h2>2) Get OBO-Edit</h2>
<p>Download the latest version of OBO-Edit from our SourceForge project 
at&nbsp;<a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geneontology">http://sourceforge.net/projects/geneontology</a></p>
<p>There will be several downloads to choose from.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are a <b>Windows</b> (PC) user: Always download the Windows installer 
  <li>If you are a <b>Mac</b> user: You can either use the Mac installer or the 
  platform independent installation. The Mac installer is easy to use, and will 
  create a shortcut in the Mac OS dock for you. However, the installer software 
  we use seems to introduce a lot of memory overhead. Many Mac users have 
  reported better performance from the platform independent release. 
  <li>If you are a <b>Linux/Unix</b> user: Choose between the platform independent release, 
  the Linux release, or the general Unix release. The
  platform independent release is probably your most reliable choice.</li></ul>
<h2>3) Install and Launch OBO-Edit</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you are using a platform-specific installer: Run the installer program 
  and follow the onscreen prompts. Icons for running/uninstalling 
  the program will be created on your start menu (or dock, or whatever). 
  <li>If you are using the platform independent version: 
  Unzip the .tar.gz archive you downloaded (on unix platforms, run "tar zxvf &lt;filename&gt;") into the directory of your 
  choice. On Unix platforms (including Mac OS), run the "oboedit" 
  shell script to start the program (to do this on most Unix platforms, 
  go to the OBO-Edit directory and type "./oboedit"). On other platforms, launch 
  the oboedit.jar file in the OBO-Edit installation directory. This can be done 
  either by double-clicking, or by running the command "java -jar oboedit.jar" 
  at a command prompt.</li></ul>
<h2>4) Get an ontology</h2>
<p>Download an ontology from the Open Biological Ontologies site at <a 
href="http://obo.sourceforge.net/">http://obo.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<h2>5) Open the ontology</h2>
<p>Go to the "File" menu and choose "Load...". A box will appear that looks like 
this...</p>
<p><IMG height=180 hspace=0 src="../images/simple_load.gif" width=441 align=center border=0></p>
<p>Choose "OBO Flat File Adapter" from the "Data adapter" dropdown list. Click 
the browse button and find your ontology file on the disk, or type the path to 
the file you want to load into the "Load files" field. Click the "Ok" 
button.</p>
<p>Your file is loaded! Tinker away.</p>
