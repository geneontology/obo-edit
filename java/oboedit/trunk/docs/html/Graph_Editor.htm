<h1>The Graph Editor Panel</h1>
<p>The Graph Editor Panel is included in the default Edit layout.  It provides a
graphical way to browse and edit your ontology.  The terms in your ontology are
shown as nodes in the graph, and the relationships form the links.
</p>
<p><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_whole_window.png"></p>
<p>A small section of ontology appears as a series of boxes 
representing terms, and lines representing relationships. If you mouse over a 
term, then a number of small blue icons will appear in the corners, and a red 
icon will appear at the bottom in the center. If you click the red icon that 
term will no longer be shown in the view.</p>
<p><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_term_controls.png"></p>
<p>If you click on&nbsp;either of the blue icons in the top corners then a menu 
will&nbsp;appear showing a list of all parent terms. If you check the box next 
to the name of&nbsp; parent term then this term will be shown in the view. If 
you right click on either of the blue icons in the bottom corners then you will be 
offered the list of child terms. If there blue corner icons are grayed out then 
it means that there are no other children or parents. </p>
<p><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_parent_or_child_menu.png"></p>
<p>If you do not have the reasoner turned on, then opening a new child or parent 
term will open only that term. The full path to the root will not be opened. This 
applies both to implied and realized links. Even if the links are included in 
your ontology file, the full path will not automatically be shown unless the 
reasoner is on. </p>
<p><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_expansion_without_reasoner.png"></p>
<p>If you turn on the reasoner then the full path to the root will be shown. The 
dashed lines indicate the relationships that have been filled in by the 
reasoner. </p>
<p><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_expansion_with_reasoner.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not wish to run the reasoner then you can just use the menus to 
select all of the terms that are needed to work up the graph as far as the root. 
</p>
<p><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_full_manual_expansion.png"></p>
<p>Right-clicking on one of the blue icons gives a menu of editing and display 
options. <IMG src="../images/graph_editor_right_cick.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of other controls and navigation aids available. All are 
visible in the window below.</p>
<p><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_whole_window.png"></p>
<p><strong>Zooming</strong>: The blue vertical bar in the top left of the white 
area is a zoom control. If you click at the top or bottom of this then graph 
will zoom in or out.</p>
<p><strong>Whole page view</strong>: The blue box in the bottom right of the 
white window is a navigation aid that gives a view of the entire open graph. 
This enables you find out where you are in the graph if you are viewing a very 
large number of terms. This small window can be made larger by dragging the 
small circles round the edges. </p>
<p><strong>Toolbar</strong>: The 
toolbar at the top of the component contains a number of editing controls. 
Dragging the grey bar at the left of the toolbar will cause it 
to become free-floating. From left to right the controls are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Drag and drop tool</strong> - Select terms or links. Selected terms are outlined in a broad 
  light blue line, and selected links are shown with a broad light blue line.) Drag terms onto other terms to create new links, move terms or 
  merge terms, or right-click for a popup menu of edits. Double-click or 
  shift-double-click to modify the selection. Drag with the middle mouse button 
  to rubber band select. 
  <li><strong>Link creation tool</strong> - Click and drag 
  to create new links between terms. If a group of terms is selected and the 
  drag is initiated from one of the selected terms, links will be added between 
  all selected terms and the target term. 
  <li><strong>Node creation tool </strong>- Click an existing term to add a new 
  is_a child. Click on empty space to create a new root term. 
  <li><strong>Eraser tool</strong> - Click an existing term or link (or group of 
  selected terms and links) to delete them. 
  <li><strong>Clone tool</strong> - Click an existing term (or group of selected 
  terms) to create clones of the target term(s).</li></ul>
<h2>User interface configuration</h2>
<p>The Graph Editor is configured via the wrench icon in the top right of the 
component. </p>

<p><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_gui_configuration.png"></p>
<p>Many of the configuration options are similar to those 
in the Ontology Tree Editor and will be covered elsewhere. However, the GUI 
settings are specific to the Graph Editor. Briefly, the controls are as 
follows:</p>
<UL>
  <li><strong>Show toolbar</strong>: 
  Controls under what circumstances the hotkey menu will appear. 
  <li><strong>Enable animations</strong>: Turns off and on the animation of graph rearrangements. 
  <li><strong>Animation duration</strong>: Controls the speed at which animations occur. 
  <li><strong>Expand full path</strong>: Causes the full path to root to be expanded when a new term is 
  selected. 
  <li><strong>Tooltips</strong>         
   : Gives the option of showing or hiding tooltips, and of showing tooltips with 
  or without the flare. The flare is the line from the cursor to the tooltip that makes the tooltip resemble a speech bubble. 
  </li></UL>
<H2>Tooltips for explanation</H2>
<P>Hovering over one of the control icons on a term will cause a tooltip to 
appear with information about the effect of the icon. This is show below, with 
and without the flare option.</P>
<P><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_tooltips_with_flare.png"></P>
<p><IMG src="../images/graph_editor_tooltips_without_flare.png"></p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Explanation component versus Graph Editor tooltips</H2>
<P>On hovering over&nbsp;a link, a tooltip will appear to show why the link is 
there. Many links are added by curators, but some are added by the reasoner. 
In&nbsp;the latter case the logic behind the addition will be shown. The same 
information is also shown in the separate Explanation Component, giving a wider 
range of viewing styles, and the option of cutting and pasting the explanations. 
The explanation component is only available if the reasoner is running. </P>

<h2>Tip: getting "regulates" links to show up</h2>
<p>Users sometimes ask how to get regulates links to show up in the Graph Editor.  The answer is that earlier versions (pre-b34) of OBO-Edit2 came with a built-in link filter that showed only transitive links (which the "regulates" links are not).  Even if you have installed later versions of OBO-Edit2, that filter is stored in your user configuration.
</p><p>
To fix this, open the Global Filters component and select "Link filters".  If you have that transitive filter, you will see it:
</p><p>
<IMG src="../images/global-link-filter.png" border=0>
</p><p>
Use the "-" button to remove that filter and click "Save Changes".  You will then need to quit and restart OBO-Edit in order to see the regulates links.  (This is a bug--global filter changes should take effect immediately, but they don't always.)
Once you remove that "is transitive" filter and restart, you should see the regulates links:
</p><p>
<IMG src="../images/regulates-links.png" border=0>
</p>
<p>
If you don't like the regulates icons or colors, you can change them in the "Icons &amp; Colors" tab of the <A href="Configuration_Manager.htm#icons">Configuration Manager</a>.

<h1>Detangling the Graph Editor display by hiding disjoint_from links</h1>
<hr>

<p>
If your ontology has a lot of "disjoint_from" links, the graph display can
become rather tangled.  You can detangle it somewhat by adding a link filter
to hide
those links:  "Select links where Type that don't have a ID that equals the value
disjoint_from"
or, in the syntax at the bottom of the link search panel, <code>link.type(id NOT equals "disjoint_from")</code>.
</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/disjoint-from-link-filter.png" border=0></p>
<p>The drawback of adding this link filter is that any time you perform an ontology
edit (for example, using the Text Editor to change the wording of a definition
or add a dbxref), OBO-Edit runs all the link filters, and this "disjoint_from"
filter is very expensive to perform.  You will thus see very slow editing
performance--for example, with this filter in place, a text edit of the GO
ontology takes 13 seconds to commit.  We suggest that you use this filter only
when necessary, and don't save it as a global link filter that will be applied
every time you open OBO-Edit.
