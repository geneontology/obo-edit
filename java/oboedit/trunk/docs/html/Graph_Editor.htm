<h1>The Graph Editor Panel</h1>
<p>The Graph Editor Panel is included in the default Edit layout.  It provides a
graphical way to browse and edit your ontology.  The terms in your ontology are
shown as nodes in the graph, and the relationships form the links.

<h2>Tip: getting "regulates" links to show up</h2>
<p>Users sometimes ask how to get regulates links to show up in the Graph Editor.  The answer is that earlier versions (pre-b34) of OBO-Edit2 came with a built-in link filter that showed only transitive links (which the "regulates" links are not).  Even if you have installed later versions of OBO-Edit2, that filter is stored in your user configuration.
</p><p>
To fix this, open the Global Filters component and select "Link filters".  If you have that transitive filter, you will see it:
</p><p>
<img src="../images/global-link-filter.png" border=0>
</p><p>
Use the "-" button to remove that filter and click "Save Changes".  You will then need to quit and restart OBO-Edit in order to see the regulates links.  (This is a bug--global filter changes should take effect immediately, but they don't always.)
Once you remove that "is transitive" filter and restart, you should see the regulates links:
</p><p>
<img src="../images/regulates-links.png" border=0>
</p>
<p>
If you don't like the regulates icons or colors, you can change them in the "Icons & Colors" tab of the <a href="Configuration_Manager.htm#icons">Configuration Manager</a>.

<h1>Detangling the Graph Editor display by hiding disjoint_from links</h1>
<hr>
<p>
If your ontology has a lot of "disjoint_from" links, the graph display can
become rather tangled.  You can detangle it somewhat by adding a link filter
to hide
those links:  "Select links where Type that don't have a ID that equals the value
disjoint_from"
or, in the syntax at the bottom of the link search panel, <code>link.type(id NOT equals "disjoint_from")</code>.
</p>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/disjoint-from-link-filter.png" border=0></P>
<p>The drawback of adding this link filter is that any time you perform an ontology
edit (for example, using the Text Editor to change the wording of a definition
or add a dbxref), OBO-Edit runs all the link filters, and this "disjoint_from"
filter is very expensive to perform.  You will thus see very slow editing
performance--for example, with this filter in place, a text edit of the GO
ontology takes 13 seconds to commit.  We suggest that you use this filter only
when necessary, and don't save it as a global link filter that will be applied
every time you open OBO-Edit.
