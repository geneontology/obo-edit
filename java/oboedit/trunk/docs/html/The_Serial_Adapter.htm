<h1>The Serial Adapter</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Read 
and writes the Java Serial File format. This is a binary file format for writing 
Java objects to disk. This adapter basically flushes the OBO-Edit datamodels 
directly to disk. The compact binary&nbsp;data is further compressed before it is written to 
disk, so these files are much smaller than the text files written by other adapters.</p>
<p><strong>Supported features:</strong> Because this adapter does a raw save of the datamodels to disk, every 
feature of the ontology is preserved. However, these files have a major 
limitation: serial files created by one version of OBO-Edit cannot be read by 
another version of OBO-Edit. Even a very minor change to the OBO-Edit datamodels 
can make a serial file obsolete and unreadable. Therefore, serial files are 
appropriate as small backup files, but should never be used as primary data 
storage.</p>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<h3>Basic Operation</h3>
<p>The Serial Adapter's basic mode conforms to the interface described 
in&nbsp;<A href="The_Basic_Flat_File_Interface.htm">The Basic Flat File 
Interface</A>.</p>
<H3>Advanced Operation</H3>
<P>The Serial Adapter has no Advanced mode. It reads in a single file and writes 
a single file. That's it.</P>
