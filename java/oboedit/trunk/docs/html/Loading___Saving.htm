<H1>Loading &amp; Saving</H1>
<P>To load or save an ontology, use the "File" menu:</P>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/load_save_menu.png" border=0></p>
<P>Choose "Load ontologies..." or "Save As..." (Command-s). A window like this will appear:</P>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/load_save_dialog.png" border=0></p>
<P>The top line is the same regardless of whether you are loading,
saving, or doing some other operation. The drop down box contains a list of data adapters that support the current
operation (some data adapters can only save data, some can only load, so not all
adapters may appear for all operations). To choose a different data adapter,
select it from the dropdown list.  Use the "Browse" button to select a file to
load or save to.</P>
<div class="sidebar">
<h1>Tip: browsing a particular directory</h1>
<hr>
<p class="sidebar">
You can point the file browser to a particular directory by typing the
directory path in the file textbox before clicking the "Browse" button.
</p></div>
<P>Some data adapters have two interfaces for setting options, a "Basic"
interface and an "Advanced" interface. The Advanced interface will be more
complex, and allow more options to be controlled by the user. If a data adapter
has the option to choose between Advanced and Basic mode, the "Advanced/Basic"
button will be enabled. Click the button to switch between basic and advanced
modes.</P>
<P>The blue triangle button displays the stored profile controls. Click it to
display the stored profile settings or save a new profile. Some adapters have very complex settings. The stored adapter settings allow
you to save a collection of settings to reuse in the future.</P>
<P>To&nbsp;load a&nbsp;stored profile, click the arrow button&nbsp;at the right
of the stored profile list and click a profile name to select it.
To create a new profile, choose "&lt;new profile&gt;" from the list. Note
that the data adapter settings will be cleared. Type a name for the new profile
in the stored profile text box, and press the Enter key to save your
settings.</P>
<P>To hide the stored profile settings, press the triangular stored profile
button again.</P>
<h2>Loading two or more ontologies</h2>
<p>To load more ontologies at the same time, click the "File" menu and choose "Load ontologies...".
Then, select "Advanced" interface.</p>
<p>Click the "Add" button to add ontology files (e.g., Gene Ontology and ChEBI ontology). You can add more than one ontology, but you need to pay attention because some
ontology files are very big and OBO-Edit might get really slow.</p>
<p>You can also create a "&lt;new profile&gt;" (e.g., go-chebi).</p>
Then the window that you see looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../images/chebi-go.png" width="888" height="492" border="0" alt=""></p>
<h2><a name="filter">Filtered save</a></h2>
<p>
You can save just the ontology terms that match a particular search.  The
way to do this is with a <a href="Loading___Saving.htm#filter">filtered save</a>.
</p>
<p>In the File menu, choose Save As. When the 'Write ontology' window appears, click the "Advanced" button.
You will see a window like this:  
<p><img src="../images/write-ontology-advanced.png" border="0" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the Add button to create a new save profile.
<p><img src="../images/write-ontology-add-save-profile.png" border="0" alt=""></p>
<p>Set the save path by typing or pasting into the text box that says "<new save path>"
or choose a file path by clicking the "Browse" button.
Tick the 'Filter terms' box; a set of filter controls
will appear. 
(You may need to make the window bigger so you can see all the fields.)
These filter controls work just like the
searching/filtering system in the main OBO-Edit window. At this point,
you can create a filter manually (use the + button to add a new filter
expression) or load a filter that you have already saved by clicking
the "open folder" icon to locate your filter file.
Click the "OK" button at the bottom of the window to save the
the filtered terms into your chosen file.
(Note that saving will be slower than usual because of the filtering
step.)
