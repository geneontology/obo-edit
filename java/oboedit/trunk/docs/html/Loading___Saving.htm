<H1>Loading &amp; Saving</H1>
<P>To load or save an ontology, click the "File" menu:</P>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/load_save_menu.png" border=0></p>
<P>Choose "Load ontologiess..." or "Save As..." (Command-s). A window like this will appear:</P>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/load_save_dialog.png" border=0></p>
<P>The top line is the same regardless of whether you are loading,
saving, or doing some other operation. The drop down box contains a list of data adapters that support the current
operation (some data adapters can only save data, some can only load, so not all
adapters may appear for all operations). To choose a different data adapter,
select it from the dropdown list.  Use the "Browse" button to select a file to
load or save to.</P>
<P>Some data adapters have two interfaces for setting options, a "Basic"
interface and an "Advanced" interface. The Advanced interface will be more
complex, and allow more options to be controlled by the user. If a data adapter
has the option to choose between Advanced and Basic mode, the "Advanced/Basic"
button will be enabled. Click the button to switch between basic and advanced
modes.</P>
<P>The blue triangle button displays the stored profile controls. Click it to
display the stored profile settings or save a new profile. Some adapters have very complex settings. The stored adapter settings allow
you to save a collection of settings to reuse in the future.</P>
<P>To&nbsp;load a&nbsp;stored profile, click the arrow button&nbsp;at the right
of the stored profile list and click a profile name to select it.
To create a new profile, choose "&lt;new profile&gt;" from the list. Note
that the data adapter settings will be cleared. Type a name for the new profile
in the stored profile text box, and press the Enter key to save your
settings.</P>
<P>To hide the stored profile settings, press the triangular stored profile
button again.</P>
<h2>Loading two or more ontologies</h2>
<p>To load more ontologies at the same time, click the "File" menu and choose "Load ontologies...".
Then, select "Advanced" interface.</p>
<p>Click the "Add" button to add ontology files (e.g., Gene Ontology and ChEBI ontology). You can add more than one ontology, but you need to pay attention because some
ontology files are very big and OBO-Edit might get really slow.</p>
<p>You can also create a "&lt;new profile&gt;" (e.g., go-chebi).</p>
Then the window that you see looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../images/chebi-go.png" width="888" height="492" border="0" alt=""></p>
