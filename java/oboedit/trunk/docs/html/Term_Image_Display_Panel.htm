<h1>Term Image Display Panel</h1>

<p>The Term Image Display Panel enables users to view an image that is connected
to an ontology term. For example, in the GO cellular component ontology a user
can select the term 'Chloroplast' in the Ontology Editor Panel, and view
images of chloroplasts in the Term Image Display Panel.</p>

<p>This component is currently available as a plugin.  It requires a bit of work
to get it and set it up.</p>
<h2>Installing the plugin</h2>
<h3>Getting the Source</h3>
<p>First you need to <a target=_new href="http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php?OBO-Edit:_Getting_the_Source_Code">obtain the OBO, BBOP, and OBO-Edit source code</a>, if you don't already have it.
You then need to check out the plugin source code from
<a target=_new href="https://geneontology.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geneontology/java/oboedit-plugins/"/>https://geneontology.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geneontology/java/oboedit-plugins/</a>.
If you're running from the shell, go to the directory where you want the plugin code to go.  Then say:
<br>
<code>svn co https://geneontology.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geneontology/java/oboedit-plugins/ plugins
</code>
</p>

<h3>Building imageplugin.jar</h3>
<p>Go to the plugins/ImagePlugin directory.
Now edit build.xml to tell it where to find the BBOP, OBO, and OBO-Edit code relative to the current
directory.  You should then be able to build the jar by saying "ant".</p>

<h3>Where to put imageplugin.jar</h3>
<p>
OBO-Edit looks for jars in two places:
<ul>
<li> The directory <code>&lt;OBO-Edit Installation Dir&gt;/extensions</code></li>
<li> The directory  <code>&lt;Your OBO-Edit Configuration Dir&gt;/extensions</code></li>
</ul>
I would suggest the first one, since you may end up deleting your configuration directory
if it clashes with a future OBO-Edit version.
You will probably
need to create the extensions subdirectory in your OBO-Edit directory before you
can copy imageplugin.jar to it.
</p>

<h3>Launching the term image plugin</h3>
<p>Once you've put imageplugin.jar in the appropriate place, restart OBO-Edit.  You should see the menu item "Term Image Display Panel" in the Show -> Info menu.
</p>

<h3>Adding term images</h3>
<p>OBO-Edit looks for images in the directory  <code>&lt;Your OBO-Edit Configuration Dir&gt;/images</code>
</p>
<p>The images are associated with terms by the term IDs.  For example, if you wanted to have
an image of a chromosome show up when the user selects "chromosome" (GO:0005694), you'd
save the chromosome image in a file called GO_0005694.jpg and put it in the images subdirectory
in your configuration directory.</p>
<p>Once this is done, the image will
automatically appear in the Term Image Display Panel when its associated term
is selected.
