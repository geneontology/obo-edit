<h1>Term Image Display Panel</h1>

<p>The Term Image Display Panel enables users to view an image that is connected
to an ontology term (via the term's ID). For example, in the GO cellular component ontology a user
can select the term 'mitochondrion' in the Ontology Editor Panel and see an image
of a mitochondrion in the Term Image Display Panel.</p>

<h2>Adding term images</h2>
<p>OBO-Edit looks for images in the directory  <code>&lt;Your OBO-Edit Configuration Dir&gt;/images</code>
</p>
<p>The images are associated with terms by the term IDs.  For example, if you wanted to have
an image of a chromosome show up when the user selects "chromosome" (GO:0005694), you'd
save the chromosome image in a file called GO_0005694.jpg (note the underscore
  used between "GO" and the GO ID number) and put it in the images subdirectory
in your configuration directory. Once this is done, the image will
automatically appear in the Term Image Display Panel when its associated term
is selected.
</p>
<p>OBO-Edit is distributed with a few pre-loaded term images.  Currently,
  these are for GO cellular component terms 0005623, 0005739, 0005783, and
  0005794.
