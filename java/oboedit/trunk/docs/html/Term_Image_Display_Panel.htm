explain how to get that plugin--or maybe it should come with the standard
OBO-Edit installation.</font>

The Term Image Display Panel enables users to view an image that is connected
to an ontology term. For example, in the GO cellular component ontology a user
can select the term 'Chloroplast' in the Ontology Editor Panel, and view
images of chloroplasts in the Term Image Display Panel.

It is easy to add new images to your ontology. To do this, make sure
the filename of the image file is the term identifier for the term with which the image will be
connected. For example, in this case the term is
GO:0009507 and the image was given the name GO_0009507.jpg. Then
save the image to your .oboeditbeta/images folder. Once this is done, the image will
automatically appear in the Term Image Display Panel when its associated term
is selected.
