<h1>Moving</h1>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by:</strong> Drag and drop, right-click</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: Command+X</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements:</strong> One or more source relationships required</p>
<P><STRONG>Target requirement</STRONG>: One target required</P>
</div>
<p>The move operation removes a parent relationship from a 
term, and creates a new relationship with a different parent. The move operation 
is analagous to an of "<A href="Adding_New_Relationships.htm">Add Child</A>" operation and a "<A 
href="Deleting.htm">Delete</A>" operation from 
the original parent.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;move one or more relationships, select a collection of source 
relationships that you would like to move. Then, select a target term to which 
they will be&nbsp;moved by right-clicking the target term or by 
drag-and-drop.</p>
<p>The move&nbsp;menu item has a flyout submenu of the relationship type that 
should be used when creating the new relationships:</p>

<p>Select the relationship type you would like for the new relationship, and it 
will be created. If you would like the new relationship to use the same 
relationship type as the original source relationship, use the "Use original 
type" menu option. This is particularly useful if you are creating several 
relationships at once by using a number of source relationships. If "Use 
original type" is used with untyped source relationships (ie one or more of your 
sources is an ontology root) the is_a relationship is used. </p>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>    
<p> When dragging, you can use hotkeys to specify the "Move" edit operation. 
<p>To specify "Move", press the "Command" and "X" keys on
the keyboard, then start dragging. The hotkey dropdown menu will
change to "Move" and title above the terms you are dragging
will change from "Dragging" to "Move..."</p>

<p>Note that if you want to use hotkeys to drag from one Ontology
Editor Panel to another, you must specify the "Move" operation in
<strong>both</strong> Ontology Editor Panels.</p>

<p>You can also use hotkeys to choose which relationship type will be
assigned when you drop the dragged terms. Each relationship type is
assigned a hotkey (Command+another key, usually just the number that
corresponds to the relationship type's position in the list, but IS_A
always gets the hotkey "I").</p>
