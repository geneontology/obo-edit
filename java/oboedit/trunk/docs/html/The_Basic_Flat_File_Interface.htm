<h1>The Basic Flat File Interface</h1>
<p>All OBO-Edit flat file adapters share the same interface 
in Basic mode. The interface looks like this:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/load_save_dialog.png" border=0></p>
<h2>Loading</h2>
<p>OBO-Edit can load as many ontology files as you want at one time (with some adapter 
specific exceptions; for example, the flat file adapter can only load a single 
definitions file).</p>
<p>Files or URLs can be loaded by typing them into the text box. To specify 
multiple files, enter a space-separated list of files and/or URLs. If the filenames 
contain spaces, the spaces can be escaped with a backslash-space combination, or 
the filename may be enclosed in quotes.</p>
<p>If the dropdown arrow to the right of the text box is pressed, a list of 
recently loaded files will appear. Click a filename to load it into the text 
box.</p>
<p>Press the "Browse..." button to open a browsing 
window to look for files on your computer.</p>
<p>Select the ontology file(s) you would like to load, and press the "Open" button. 
Multiple files can be selected by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking each 
file (on Macs, hold the "Command" key instead of Ctrl). The paths to the files you selected will appear in the text box.
Once the files have been specified, press the "Ok" button to load.</p>
<h2>Saving</h2>
  <p>Saving works similarly to loading. A file path is specified in the 
filename text box. You can look for a save location using the Browse 
button. To complete the save operation, press the ok button.</p>
<p>Note that it is only possible to save onto a local disk. You cannot save to a 
URL.</p>
<p>You may only specify one save location in Basic mode. Some data adapters 
allow you to save pieces of your ontology to different files. To take advantage 
of these features, you must enable "Advanced" mode and set up your adapter 
appropriately.</p>

<h2>Restoring from Autosave Files</h2>
<p>By default, OBO-Edit periodically autosaves a copy of the ontology you're working on.  If you want to restore a version from the autosaved
  file, use the file browser to look in the directory where your autosave files are
  stored.  This is normally in your OBO-Edit configuration directory (you
  can find out where that is by opening the Configuration Manager) in a subdirectory
  called "autosave".  You will usually want to choose the most recent file.
