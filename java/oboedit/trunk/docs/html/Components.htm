<h1>Components</h1>
<p>OBO-Edit 2 has multiple components, or panels, that can be added to the display using
the top-level menus, which are organized by category (Editors, Viewers,
  Search, etc.).  You can resize components by pulling their
  edges, drag them around to rearrange them, or
even detach them from the main OBO-Edit window as free-floating windows.</p>

<p>When you add a new component to the OBO-Edit display, it will generally
appear in the same spot as the panel you were looking at when you requested
it from the menu.  Two or more components can share the spot by means
  of <b>tabs</b>.  You can select a particular component by clicking on its
  tab.  If there are more tabs than can fit in the space available, you can
access the hidden ones using the "Scroll Right", "Scroll Left", and "Tab List" buttons to the right of the
  tabs:</p>

<h1>Perspectives</h1>
<hr>
<p>OBO-Edit has several default layouts, or <i>perspectives</i>, that have a set of
components pre-loaded.
Please refer to the
section about <a href="Perspectives.htm">Perspectives</a> for more information
about configuring your OBO-Edit layout.
</p>

<h3>Component Titlebars</h3>
<p>Each component has its name in its titlebar.  You can edit the name by
  right-clicking on it.  Hit return in the text box or right-click again when you're done editing it.
</p>
<h3>Component Toolbars</h3>
<p>
Each component has a row of little icon buttons in its title bar:
</p><p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/toolbar.png" center border=0></p>
<p>If you hover your mouse over
an icon, a phrase will appear that explains what the button does.  The exact set of
icons depends on the type of component, but it may include:
<ul>
<li> A wrench or spanner icon, which means "Configure this component."  Clicking it will switch the
component to a panel that lets you change some aspects of the display.  When you are done
setting the configuration, click the checkmark icon to return to the normal component display.
<br><li> A lowercase 'f', which means "Quick filtering options."  This will pop up a menu of
<a href="Filtering.htm">filtering options</a>.
<br><li> A question mark, which means "Help."  Clicking this will launch a window showing
help for that specific component.
<br><li> A tiny globe (looks kind of like an octagon with a lightning bolt in
    it), which means "Switch to 
<a href="Working_with_Selections.htm">local selection mode</a>."
If you're in local selection mode, this icon will appear as a little house, which you can click to
switch back to <a href="Working_with_Selections.htm">global selection mode</a>.
<br><li> A little camera, which means "Save an image file of this component."
<br><li> An arrow that points upwards and to the right, which means "Undock."  This turns the
component into a free-floating window.  To return a panel to the
main OBO-Edit window, click its icon that shows an arrow pointing downwards and
to the left.
<br><li> An underscore, which means "Minimize."  If you click this icon, the component will
disappear and be replaced by a tab at the bottom of the OBO-Edit window.  To reopen a minimized
component, click the "Restore" icon in the tab, which looks like two overlapping windows.
<br><li> A rectangle, which means "Maximize."  This makes the component take over the whole
OBO-Edit window.  To restore it to its normal size, use the "Restore" button.
<br><li> An X, which means "Close."  Clicking this will remove the component from the OBO-Edit display.
(If you want it back, you can recreate it from the appropriate menu.)
</li>
</ul>
