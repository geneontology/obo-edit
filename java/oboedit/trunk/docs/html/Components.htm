<h1>Components</h1>
<p>OBO-Edit 2 has multiple components, or panels, that can be added to the display using
the [View]->[Show] menus.  The components can be dragged around to rearrange them, or
even detached from the main OBO-Edit window as free-floating windows.  
OBO-Edit has several default layouts, or <i>perspectives</i> that have a set of
components pre-loaded.
Please refer to the
section about <a href="Perspectives.htm">Perspectives</a> for more information
about configuring your OBO-Edit layout.

<h3>Component Toolbars</h3>
<p>
Each component has a row of little icon buttons in its title bar.  If you hover your mouse over
an icon, a phrase explaining what the icons means will appear.  The exact set of
icons depends on the type of component, but it may include:
<ul>
<li> A wrench or spanner icon, which means "Configure this component."  Clicking it will switch the
component to a panel that lets you change some aspects of the display.  When you are done
setting the configuration, click the checkmark icon to return to the normal component display.
<br><li> A lowercase 'f', which means "Quick filtering options."  This will pop up a menu of
filtering options.
<br><li> A sort of hexagon with a squiggle in it (??), which means "Switch to local selection mode."
If you're in local selection mode, this icon will appear as a little house, which you can click to
switch back to global selection mode.
<br><li> An arrow that points upwards and to the right, which means "Undock."  This turns the
component into a free-floating window.  To return a panel to the
main OBO-Edit window, click its icon that shows an arrow pointing downwards and
to the left.
<br><li> An underscore, which means "Minimize."  If you click this icon, the component will
disappear and be replaced by a tab at the bottom of the OBO-Edit window.  To reopen a minimized
component, click the "Restore" icon in the tab, which looks like two overlapping windows.
<br><li> A rectangle, which means "Maximize."  This makes the component take over the whole
OBO-Edit window.  To restore it to its normal size, use the "Restore" button.
<br><li> An X, which means "Close."  Clicking this will remove the component from the OBO-Edit display.
(If you want it back, use the [View] -> [Show] menu.)
<br><li> A question mark, which means "Help."  Clicking this will launch a window showing
help for that specific component.
</li>
