<h1>Components</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OBO-Edit 2 has multiple components that can be added to the display using
  the "Show" menu.  The components can be dragged around to rearrange them, or
even detached from the main OBO-Edit window as free-floating windows.  See the
section about <a href="Perspectives.htm">Perspectives</a> for more information
about configuring your view.

About the little icons on each component
</p><p>
Most components have a "?" icon.  If you click this, it will launch a window
with help for that specific component.
