<H1>Text Checks</H1>
<P>Comment checks, definition checks, name checks and 
synonym checks are all very similar, so they are all discussed in this 
section.</P>
<P>A text check looks for the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Misspelled words</STRONG> 
    - A warning will appear if the text contains a misspelled word according
    to the current dictionary file (dictionary.dict, in the OBO-Edit resources).
  <LI><STRONG>Repeated words</STRONG> 
  - A warning will appear if the text contains a repeated word. Of course, some 
  words should be repeated, so OBO-Edit maintains a list of legally repeatable 
  words. Use the appropriate <A 
  href="The_Verification_Plugin.htm#quickfix">quick fix</A> to add a word to the 
  list of allowed repeats.
  <LI><STRONG>Repeated whitespace</STRONG> - A warning will appear if multiple 
  whitespace characters (like spaces or tabs) appear in a row.
  <LI><STRONG>Sentence case</STRONG> - A warning will appear if a new sentence 
  starts with a lower-case letter. Sometimes sentences should start with a lower 
  case letter, so OBO-Edit provides a <A 
  href="The_Verification_Plugin.htm#quickfix">quick fix</A> that allows a word 
  to be added to a list of words that may legally appear at the beginning of a 
  sentence in lower case.
  <LI><STRONG>Sentence punctuation</STRONG> (definitions and comments only) - A 
  warning will appear if a definition or comment doesn't end with appropriate 
  punctuation.
  <LI><STRONG>Sentence separation</STRONG> - A warning will appear if a period, 
  question mark or exclamation point is not followed by a space. Sometimes a 
  period should not be followed by a space (for example, in an abbreviation), so 
  OBO-Edit provides a quick fix that adds a word to a list of legal 
  abbreviations. OBO-Edit knows the abbreviations "i.e.", "e.g." and "etc." by 
  default.</LI></UL>
<P>A text check can be configured by clicking the "Configure" button in the 
Verification Manager:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 
src="../images/verification_plugin_textedit_config.png" border=0></P>
<P>Each line of the configuration window configures one of the checks listed 
above. Each check can be configured to run under one of the following 
conditions:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Threaded checks only</STRONG> - This [***fill in explanation!!!***]

  <LI><STRONG>On Text Edit</STRONG> - This 
  part of the text&nbsp;check will only be run before committing a text edit 
  <LI><STRONG>Always</STRONG> - This part 
  of the text check will always be run. 
  <LI><STRONG>Never</STRONG> - This part of the text check will never be 
  run.</LI></UL>
<P>The default setting for all checks is <STRONG>Always</STRONG>.</P>
<p>The <a href="Text_Editing.htm">Text Editor</a> performs text checks on the
selected term.  If there are any errors or warnings, this is indicated in the
  Text Editor title bar.  To see the warnings, hover your
mouse over the title bar for a few seconds; a window listing the warnings will
pop up.
