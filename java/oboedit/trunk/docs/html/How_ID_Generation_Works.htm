<H1>How ID Generation Works</H1>
<H2>The System</H2>
<P>ID generation works differently for relations and 
terms.</P>
<P>When a new relation is created, OBO-Edit displays a prompt where the new 
relation ID can be entered. The user can type in anything they want, 
provided:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The characters in the ID name are legal OBO 
  identifier characters 
  <LI>The ID is not already in use.</LI></UL>
<P>              
         When a new term is created, 
OBO-Edit determines which <STRONG>ID generation rule</STRONG> to use (see <A 
href="The_ID_Manager_Plugin.htm">The ID Manager</A> for how the 
current rule is specified). This rule contains information about what new IDs 
should look like.</P>
<P>At a minimum, an ID generation rule specifies some fixed text that must 
appear in a new ID. Usually, the rule also specifies a fixed-length string of 
numbers that may appear in the new ID. The actual <EM>contents</EM> of this number 
string are not specified; the rule just says that a number of a certain length 
should appear at a certain position in a newly generated ID.</P>
<P>OBO-Edit then searches all the terms (live and obsolete) in the entire 
ontology to see which IDs are already in use. OBO-Edit then generates an ID 
satisfies the ID generation rule. If the ID rule requires a numeric sequence to 
appear in new IDs, OBO-Edit generates the lowest possible number that is not 
already in use.</P>
<P>In this way, OBO-Edit guarantees that no ID is ever reused, and that the ID 
space is used efficiently. That is, if the IDs "GO:003" and "GO:005" are in use, 
but for some reason "GO:004" is not in use, the next term that OBO-Edit 
generates will be "GO:004" (assuming that the ID generation rule is 
"GO:$sequence(3)$").</P>
<H2>Limitations of the System</H2>
<P>OBO-Edit can only work with what it's given. It assumes that if an ID does 
not appear in any of the currently loaded ontologies, that ID is free to be 
given to a new term.</P>
<P>This is not always true. For example, an ontology may have been filtered in such a way that it was 
saved into 2 or 3 files. Later, a user may load only one of those files. If the 
pieces of the ontology in each file use the same namespace, a newly created term 
could be assigned an ID that is currently in use in a part of the ontology that 
has not been loaded. This&nbsp;can have <EM>disastrous</EM> results when all the 
pieces of the ontology are loaded again, since OBO-Edit will assume that the two 
terms with the same ID are actually the <EM>same</EM> term. At best, there will 
be&nbsp;a load error. For this reason, one should never edit an ontology that is 
only partially loaded.</P>
<P>This is also why it is so dangerous to use the <A 
href="Destroying.htm">Destroy</A>&nbsp;command. If&nbsp;a term is destroyed, its 
ID goes back into circulation for use in new term creation, and that ID will 
probably be reused immediately. If the term that was destroyed was 
ever&nbsp;included in a publicly available version of your 
ontology,&nbsp;external database and applications that use your ontology may 
become confused by this ID reuse. For example, tools like&nbsp;<A 
href="obodiff.htm">obodiff</A>&nbsp;will think that instead of destroying a term 
and creating a new term somewhere else, you have kept the old term in the 
ontology but changed all its parents, children, its name, its defintion, and all 
its other attributes.</P>
<P>Applications assume that a term ID will be used <EM>for a single term and 
never again</EM>. That is why terms are obsoleted instead of destroyed: we need 
to keep an audit trail of IDs that have been used. If it is possible to reuse an 
ID through the use of the destroy command or ontology filtering, this assumption 
does not hold, and applications everywhere become deeply 
confused.</P>
