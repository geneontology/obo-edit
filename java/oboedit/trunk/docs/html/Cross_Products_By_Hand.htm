<h1>Cross Products By Hand</h1>
<p>OBO-Edit treats intersections as special cases of regular relationships. When 
OBO-Edit sees the following line in an OBO file:</p><pre>intersection_of: functions_in go_ext:hair</pre>
<p>OBO-Edit creates a special relationship to <strong>go_ext:hair</strong> with the type 
<strong>functions_in.</strong> This special relationship acts like 
a normal relationship in most ways, but&nbsp;it is flagged 
in the datamodels (and in the display) 
to indicate that this relationship is involved in an 
intersection.</p>
<p>These special relationships are normally hidden, because there is no reason 
to see them if you are <A href="Cross_Products_in_the_Text_Editor.htm">editing 
cross products in the text editor</a> .</p>

<p>However, since intersection relationships are just like any other relationship to 
OBO-Edit, you can view and edit intersection relationships in the <A 
href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">ontology tree editor panel</a>.&nbsp;<strong>THIS IS NOT 
A GOOD IDEA.</strong> The only reason you would need this functionality is if 
you&nbsp;intend to&nbsp;violate the genus/differentia paradigm. Therefore, this 
feature is hidden by default.</p>
<p>But you can turn it on. Don't say we didn't warn you.</p>
<h2>Displaying Intersections in the Ontology Tree Editor Panel</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the "Plugins" menu and choose the "Global Filter Plugin". 
  <li>Click the "Filters" tab. You should see this:<br><IMG height=261 hspace=0 src="../images/enabling_cross_products_by_hand1.gif" width=367 border=0>.<br>By 
  default, OBO-Edit contains an item that filters out all intersection links in 
  the main view. The filter will appear in the "Link filters" section, and will 
  be&nbsp;labeled "Link has NOT Is complete". 
  <li>Click the link filter to select it. The screen will change to look like 
  this:<br><IMG height=258 hspace=0 src="../images/enabling_cross_products_by_hand2.gif" width=369 border=0> 
  <li>Click the "Del" button underneath the link filter. The Link filter will 
  disappear. 
  <li>Click the "Save Changes" button to make this change permanent.</li></ol>
<p>Intersection links will now appear in the main viewer. They are marked with a 
red triangle:<br></p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h1>Weird implications</h1>
<p align="left">If the reasoner is turned on and you have loaded an ontology 
containing intersections, OBO-Edit will find a number of implied links. Since 
there's a real difference between intersection links and all other links, 
OBO-Edit creates an implied link for every intersection link it finds. This can 
lead to a confusing displays like this:</p>
<p align="center"><IMG height=39 hspace=0 src="../images/intersection_link_graphic.gif" width=157 border=0></p>
<p align="left">The term "autophagy cell" seems to appear twice under the same 
parent with the same relationship type. </p>
<p align="left">This is not a bug. This is OBO-Edit trying to make it clear that 
the intersection link "<strong>is_a</strong> autophagy cell" implies the normal 
link "<strong>is_a</strong> autophagy cell".</p></div>
