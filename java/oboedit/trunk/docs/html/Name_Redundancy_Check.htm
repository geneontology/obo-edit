<H1>Name Redundancy Check</H1>
<P>This check ensures that term names in the ontology are 
unique, and issues a warning if they are not. Note that name uniqueness is not 
required, but it's a good idea.</P>
<P>This check displays a warning if:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Two terms have the same primary name</LI>
  <LI>A term name is the same as an exact synonym of some ontology term</LI>
  <LI>An exact term synonym matches the name of some ontology term</LI>
  <li>Two terms have the same exact synonym</li>
</ul>
<P>Note that a redundant name will always cause at least 2 warnings to be 
generated, because a warning will appear for each term that shares the name or 
synonym.</P>

<P>If two terms have the same synonym, but the synonym scope is not
"exact" for both terms, a warning is <EM>not</EM> generated. This is a
perfectly legal condition that can arise from a term split or
community usage conventions.</P>
