<h1>The Tree Viewer</h1>
<p>You can show the Tree Viewer (which is not in the default layouts) with 
[Viewers] -> [Tree Viewer].  (Note that this component used to be called the
  DAG View.)
The Tree Viewer displays all the possible paths to the 
currently selected term or terms:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/tree_view_single.png" border=0></p>
<p>This display shows a view of the ontology where every link that does not end 
in the selected term has been removed. Hence, every leaf in this tree is the 
currently selected term. </p>
<p>At the bottom left of the screen is a summary of the number of 
<strong>paths</strong> in the trimmed view. A <strong>path</strong> is a unique 
collection of links that leads from the selected term to the ontology root. In 
gthe example above, there are 6 paths to the root from "glycosome". Note that even if a term 
only has one parent, it may have multiple paths to the root if one of its ancestors has multiple parents. The 
sub-selection location is displayed in dark blue and all other locations of the term are shown in light blue. 
Right-clicking (alt-clicking on Mac) one of these light blue locations in the ontology will cause the sub-selection in the 
<a href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">Ontology Tree Editor</a> to be changed to the new location. </p>

<p>    
To configure the Tree Viewer, press the wrech icon in the top right corner of the panel. A configuration window will appear:</p>
<p><IMG src="../images/tree_view_config.png" border=0> </p>
<p>
Configuration options:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Show paths to multiple selected terms</strong>- If this
  checkbox is unchecked, the Tree Viewer only displays paths to a
  single term (the current sub-selection). If this box is checked, the
  Tree Viewer will show paths to all the currently selected
  terms. Note that only the location of the primary sub-selected term
  in the <a href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">Ontology Tree Editor</a>
  will display in dark blue, all other terms will be in light blue.

  <li><STRONG>Show non-transitive paths</STRONG>&nbsp;- The Tree
  Viewer normally doesn't show paths that include non-transitive
  relationship types. If this box is selected, paths with
  non-transitive relationships will be shown. This often leads to a
  highly cluttered display, as in the following example.
