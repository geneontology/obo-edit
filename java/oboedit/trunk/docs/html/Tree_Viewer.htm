<h1>The Tree Viewer</h1>

<p>You can show the Tree Viewer (which is not in the default layouts) with 
[Viewers] -> [Tree Viewer].  (Note that this component used to be called the
  DAG View.)
The Tree Viewer displays all the possible paths to the 
currently selected term or terms:</p>

<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/dag_view.png" border=0></p>
<p>This display shows a view of the ontology where every link that does not end 
in the selected term has been removed. Hence, every leaf in this tree is the 
currently selected term.</p>

<p>At the bottom left of the screen is a summary of the number of 
<strong>paths</strong> in the trimmed view. A <strong>path</strong> is a unique 
collection of links that leads from the selected term to the ontology root. In 
the example above, there are 5 paths to the root from "virion transport 
vesicle". Note that even if a term only has one parent, it may have multiple 
paths to the root if one of its ancestor has multiple parents.</p>

<p>    
              
             
             To configure 
the Tree Viewer, press the "Config" button. A configuration window will appear:</p>

<p><IMG src="../images/dagview_config.png" border=0>    
           </p>
<p>
Configuration options:
<ul>

  <li><strong>Show paths to multiple 
  selected terms</strong>- If this checkbox is unchecked, the Tree Viewer only 
  displays paths to a single term (the current sub-selection). If this box is 
  checked, the Tree Viewer will show paths to all the currently selected terms. 
  <li><strong>Collapse&nbsp;already 
  shown paths</strong> &nbsp;- In ontologies with lots of multiple 
  parentage, there may be thousands of paths to a single term. All these paths 
  can lead to a huge, jumbled and slow display. If the "Collapse" checkbox is 
  activated, any given subpath is completely expanded only once. If a subpath 
  appears again, it is collapsed. (See the screenshot above for an example. At 
  the top of the display, the relationship"virion transport vesicle 
  -<strong>is_a</strong>-&gt; intracellular membrane-bound 
  organelle" is displayed. Since that relationship has already been shown, the 
  children of "intracellular membrane-bound organelle" are collapsed near the 
  bottom of the display to save space.)
  <li><STRONG>Show non-transitive paths</STRONG>&nbsp;- The 
  Tree Viewer normally doesn't show paths that include non-transitive 
  relationship types. If this box is selected, paths with non-transitive relationships
will be shown. This often leads to a highly cluttered display.</li>
</ul>
