<h1>Configuration Manager</h1>
<p>The Configuration Manager lets you control some of the settings in OBO-Edit.
You can bring it up as a free-floating window with
  [Config]->[Configuration Manager].
If you prefer it to be docked into the main OBO-Edit window, you can use the
  little downward-curving arrow to dock it.
</p><p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/configuration_manager.png" border=0></p>
<p>When you are done adjusting your configuration options,
click the "Save Configuration" button to accept your changes and 
update the display. There are several different configuration tabs. The first tab is "General 
GUI".</p>

<h2>User Settings</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<a name="config_dir"></a>
  <li><strong>Configuration directory</strong> - 
  Displays the path to the OS-appropriate directory that contains your personal OBO-Edit 
  configuration info. This field is not editable; it is for
  informational purposes only.  You can mouse-select it and copy it to your
  clipboard to copy elsewhere, if you want.
<ul><li>
  <b>Note for Mac users</b>:  your configuration directory will be in
  ~/Library/Application Support/, e.g., /users/nomi/Library/Application Support/.
  Because that directory name has a space in it, if you are trying to use it in a shell
  command (e.g., cd), you will need
  to put quotes around that path:
  <code>cd "/users/nomi/Library/Application Support"</code>.
</li>
<li><b>Note for Windows XP users</b>:  your configuration directory will be in
Application Data\OBO-Edit-beta in your home directory.  By default, Windows
      hides this directory from you.  If you are looking at your Windows
      directories in Explorer (the usual Windows directory browser), you can
      get it to show the hidden directories by choosing "Folder Options" from
      the Tools menu, and selecting the "View" tab.  Under "Advanced
      settings", select the "Show hidden files and folders" radio button.<br>You
      can also get to your configuration directory via the Windows command
      interface by copying and pasting it from the Configuration Manager, and
      putting quotes around the path because of the spaces in it.
</li>
<li><b>Note for Unix users</b>: your configuration directory will be in
  ~/.oboeditbeta.  If you do "ls ~", you won't see it because file or
  directory names that start with "."  are
  hidden by default.  Use "ls -a" if you want to see it in the directory listing.
</li>
</ul>    
  <li><strong>Log file</strong> - The text output from OBO-Edit is saved in
  this file in your configuration directory.  It can be useful for debugging.
  This field is not editable, but can be copied and pasted elsewhere.</li>
  <li><strong>OBO-Edit memory allocation</strong> (requires restart) - 
    The text box specifies the amount of memory that should 
  be allocated to OBO-Edit. The value is given as an integer followed by the 
  letter M, indicating the number of megabytes of memory that should be 
  allocated. A high value will make OBO-Edit less likely to run out of memory and 
  crash, but will also lessen the amount of memory available to 
  other programs and may cause OBO-Edit to run slower on some platforms. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>User name</strong> - The user name OBO-Edit should use. This 
  information is used in the "saved-by" header field when using the <A 
  href="The_OBO_Adapter.htm">OBO adapter</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Font</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Default font</strong> - These controls specify the font OBO-Edit 
  should use when displaying buttons, labels, dropdown menus, etc. The first 
  dropdown specifies the font family name, the second specifies the font size, 
  and the third specifies the font style (normal, italic, bold or bold-italic). 
  The "Font preview" shows the alphabet in the selected 
  font.</li></ul>

<a name="icons"></a>
<h2>Icons and Colors</h2>
<h3>Changing relationship type icons</h3>
<p>These controls allow a custom icon to be specified for a relationship type. 
<em>This does not create new relationship types!</em> It just associates an icon 
with an existing relationship type.</p>
<p>Note that relationship types don't need a custom icon. If no icon is specified, OBO-Edit will display the default icon, consisting of a black rectangle containing the relationship type id in white text.</p>
<p>To edit an existing relationship type icon association, select a
relationship type from the list. The icon association editor will appear:</p>
</p><p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/config_icons_and_colors.png" border=0></p>
<p>To pick an image file from the local disk, press the "Browse 
files" button. To use one of OBO-Edit's built-in icons, press the "Browse 
built-in icons" button.  The "Icon URL" box will get filled in automatically.</p>
<p>To delete a relationship type icon association, left-click the association 
and press the "Del" button.</p>
<p>To add a new relationship type icon association, press the "Add" button. A 
new association will be created with the temporary id "UNKNOWN" and the icon path "&lt;new 
icon path&gt;".</p>
<p>To change the link color for a relationship, click the button below "Link
color" that says the color name (e.g., "blue (click to modify)").
</p>
</ul>
<div class="sidebar">
<h1>Why won't my is_a icon appear?</h1>
<hr>
<p class="sidebar">Longtime users of OBO-Edit or DAG-Edit may find that OBO-Edit seems to ignore their settings for the <b>is_a</b> icon, but all other icons seem to display correctly. Remember, the id for <b>is_a</b> has changed 
recently to ensure compatibility with <a 
href="http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/">the OBO relations ontology</a>. 
The new id for <strong>is_a</strong> is <strong>OBO_REL:is_a</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Changing link color</h3>
<p>Below the "Browse" buttons is the text "Link color", and the name of the color (e.g. "blue").
Click on the color name to pop up a color chooser and select a new color for links
of that particular relationship type.
As when you select a new icon, the OBO-Edit
display will not automatically refresh.  You will see the new link color when you do
something that changes the display (e.g., click open a node).</p>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Case sensitive term sorting</strong> - If this box is checked, the case of a term name will be 
  taken into account when sorting terms. Lower case letters will appear before 
  upper case letters. 
  <li><strong>Show terms ids as tool tips in term panels</strong> - If this box 
  is checked, the id of a term will appear if the mouse hovers over a term in 
  the <A href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">ontology editor panel</a>. Enabling this feature will make OBO-Edit run slightly slower 
  on older machines. 
  <li><strong>Allow new cycles to be created</strong> - If this box is checked, OBO-Edit will allow cycles to be 
  created. If it is not checked, OBO-Edit will refuse to allow new cycles to be 
  made. Only enable this option if an ontology requires cycles. Most do not. See 
  <A href="Text_Editing.htm#is_cyclic">cyclic relations</a>
  for more information about what constitutes a cycle.
  <li><strong>Use advanced root detection</strong> - If this box is selected, 
  OBO-Edit will use advanced root detection. Normally, OBO-Edit treats a term as 
  a root if it has no parents. If advanced root detection is enabled, terms with 
  no <em>transitive</em> parents are treated as roots.</li>
  <li><strong>Only one Ontology Tree Editor at a time can be in global mode</strong> - If this box is checked,
  then only one Ontology Tree Editor can be in <a href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm#global">global selection mode</a> at a
  given time.  Any other Ontology Tree Editors will automatically be put into
  local selection mode.</li>
  <li><strong>Warn before final delete</strong> - If this box is checked, OBO-Edit displays a warning before 
  the last instance of a term is deleted and the term becomes obsolete. 
  <li><strong>Warn before discarding definitions on save</strong> - If this box 
  is checked, the old <A href="The_GO_Flat_File_Adapter.htm">GO Flat File 
  Adapter</a> will 
  issue a warning when saving with no definition file. 

  <li><strong>Confirm on exit</strong>- If this 
  box is checked, OBO-Edit will ask for confirmation before exiting.</li></ul>
</ul>

<h2>Autosave</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enable autosave</strong> - If this box is checked, autosave will 
  be enabled. The ontology will be saved periodically in the autosave file
  path (see next item).  The default is for autosave
  to be enabled; you can turn this off if you prefer.
  <li><strong>Autosave file path</strong> -&nbsp;This&nbsp;field specifies&nbsp;a directory where autosave 
  files will be stored. 
  <li><strong>Do autosave every</strong> - This field specifies the number of minutes between autosaves.
  <li><strong>Autosave files expire in </strong>- The number of days old an 
  autosave file must be before it is automatically deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="textedit"></a>Text Editing</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Auto commit text edits</strong> - If this box 
  is checked, OBO-Edit commits text edits as soon as a new term is selected or 
  the ontology is saved. The user does not have to explicitly commit text edits 
  by pressing a "commit" button.
  <li><strong>Warn before discarding text edits</strong> - If <strong>Auto 
  commit text edits</strong> is not selected, this box is enabled. In manual 
  commit mode, the user must press a "commit" button to make text edits 
  permanent. If a user selects a new term without committing their text edits, 
  the edits are lost. If this box is checked, the user will see a warning if 
  uncommitted text edits are about to be discarded.
  <li><strong>Allow extended characters</strong> - If this box is selected, 
  extended (non-ASCII) characters are allowed in term names, synonyms, 
  definitions, etc. Note that this does not guarantee that non-ascii characters 
  will actually be written out to disk. Some data adapters (like the OBO 
  Adapter) currently do not allow extended characters under any circumstances.
  <li><strong>Use personal definition</strong> - If this box is selected, a user 
  may specify a default definition and dbxrefs that will automatically be used 
  when a new term is created.</li></ul>
