<h1>The Verification Manager</h1>
<p>The Verification Manager allows users control over all 
aspects of the verification system:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 
src="../images/verification_manager.png"  border=0></p>
<p>The Verification Manager has two tabs, the 
<strong>Configuration</strong> tab and the <strong>Verification Results</strong> tab.</p>
<h2>The Configuration Tab</h2>
<p>The top half of the configuration tab contains a list of 
checks. Each line contains the check name, a series of checkboxes indicating the 
events at which this check will be run, and an optional configuration button. To 
specify when a check should be run, check the boxes for each event for which the 
check should be performed.</p>
<p>In the middle of the panel is a series of checkboxes 
labeled "Show warnings". Warnings (non-fatal error messages generated by an 
ontology check) are only displayed during events that are checked in this 
panel.</p>
<p>Beneath this panel is a checkbox labeled "Check 
obsoletes?". If this box is selected, checks are run on obsolete terms. If it is 
not selected, obsolete terms are ignored.</p>
<p>Under this is a pair of buttons labeled "Add check" and 
"Remove check". If "Add check" is clicked, the User Check Editor is diplayed 
(see below). If "Remove check" is clicked, the currently selected check will be 
deleted. Only user defined checks can be deleted; built in checks cannot be 
removed, but they can be disabled by selecting no events for that check.</p>
<p>At the bottom is the "Run Manual Check" button. Clicking 
this button triggers the <strong>manual</strong> event, and all checks that are 
marked "On manual?" will be run.</p>
<h3>Built-In Checks</h3>
<p>The following checks are built-in to OBO-Edit:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Text_Checks.htm">Comment Check</a>
  <li><a href="ISA_Cycle_Check.htm"> Cycle Check</a>
  <li><a href="Dangling_Intersection_Check.htm">Dangling Intersection Check</a>
  <li><a href="Dbxref_Check.htm">Dbxref Check</a>
  <li><a href="Definition_Check.htm">Definition Check</a>
  <li><a href="Disjointedness_Check.htm">Disjointedness Check</a>
  <li><a href="ID_check.htm">ID Check</a>
  <li><a href="Name_Redundancy_Check.htm">Name Redundancy Check</a>
  <li><a href="Text_Checks.htm">Name Check</a>
  <li><a href="Text_Checks.htm">Synonym Check</a>
</ul>
<h3>User Defined Checks</h3>

<p><a name=userdefined></a>Users can create their own checks, tailored
to the needs of a particular ontology. Once created, user-defined
checks become available in the Verification Manager, and users can
specify when the check should be run.</p>
<p>See <ahref="User_Defined_Checks.htm">User-defined Checks</a> for
instructions on creating checks.
</p>
<h2>Verification Results</h2>
<p>Whenever a verification is run for any reason, the results appear in the 
<strong>Verification Results</strong> tab:</p>
<p><IMG height=445 hspace=0 src="../images/verification_plugin_results.gif" 
width=581 border=0></p>
<p>Note that often the verification results will also appear in a popup window, 
but the results of the last verification can always be reviewed in this tab of 
the verification manager. Verification results appear in a popup window when the 
verification is triggered by a special event, such as a text edit, save, load, 
or reasoner-startup.</p>
<p>The results tab will contain a list of errors and warnings. Errors are severe 
problems with the ontology that must be corrected to make the ontology compliant 
with the OBO ontology format. Warnings are less serious problems that should be 
corrected, but the ontology can be saved even if these errors are not dealt 
with.</p>
<p>Warnings are preceded by a <IMG height=16 hspace=0 
src="../images/warning.gif" width=16 border=0> icon. Errors are preceded by 
a <IMG height=16 hspace=0 src="../images/error.gif" width=16 
border=0> icon. Errors are generally listed first.</p>
<p>Warnings and error messages are grouped together by term, so that all 
warnings generated for a particular term appear together. If a term is mentioned 
in an error message or warning, the term name is a clickable hyperlink. Clicking 
the hyperlink causes that term to be selected. Note that these hyperlinks will 
not work if the verification results are displayed in an automatic popup window, 
but the window can be closed and the results plugin opened. The verification 
results will be visible in the results tab, and the hyperlinks will be clickable 
there.</p>
<p>Only the first approximately 200 warnings will be displayed (the
exact number depends how many warnings are found for the last checked
term). If the verification checks find more warnings, they won't be
shown. To reduce the number of warnings, try fixing the problems
identified in the warnings or disabling some checks.</p>
<H3>Quick Fix</H3>
<p><a name=quickfix></a>Sometimes, a warning or error will be followed by a <IMG height=16 hspace=0 
src="../images/quickfix.gif" width=16 border=0>&nbsp;icon. When this icon 
appears, it means one or more "quick fixes" are available for the problem. When 
the icon is clicked, a popup menu will appear detailing the various quick fix 
options. To apply one of the quick fixes, select it from the menu. Normally, the 
fix will be applied and the verification will be at least partly re-run to 
reflect the changes made by the quick fix. <strong>Beware: quick fixes may 
modify your ontology.</strong></p>
