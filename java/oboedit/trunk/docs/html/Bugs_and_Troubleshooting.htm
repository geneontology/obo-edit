<H1>Bugs and Troubleshooting</H1>
<P>When installing a new version of OBO-Edit, check the README 
file for a summary of changes in the new version, any known issues, and any 
last-minute release notes or documentation.</P>
<H2>.oboeditbeta</H2>
<p>OBO-Edit configuration and history files are kept in your home directory in a
(usually hidden) subdirectory called .oboeditbeta.  When you install a new
version of OBO-Edit2, it may clash with the files in your .oboeditbeta and
cause strange behavior.  If you install a new OBO-Edit and it is behaving
oddly, try removing your .oboeditbeta directory and relaunching--this often
fixes the problem.</p>
<H2>Bug Reports</H2>
<P>OBO-Edit is a work in progress. Bugs can and will creep in. Please report any 
odd behavior or bugs immediately. The OBO-Edit Working Group is very responsive 
to bug reports, and your bugs will be addressed as quickly as possible
  (especially if they have a high priority rating).</P>
<P>To report a bug, please use our Sourceforge bug tracker at: <A 
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36855&amp;atid=418257">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36855&amp;atid=418257</A>
<br>
Be sure to set the category to "OBO-Edit", the group to "OBO-Edit 2.0x", and
assign an appropriate priority score (where 9 means "fatal error that makes it
impossible to use OBO-Edit at all" and 1 means "not at all important but I
just wanted to let you know").</p>

<H2>Feature Requests</H2>
<P>We're always listening to suggestions for new OBO-Edit features. To request a 
new feature, please use our Sourceforge Feature Request Tracker at: <A 
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36855&amp;atid=418260">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36855&amp;atid=418260</A>
<br>Be sure to set the category to "OBO-Edit" (you can leave the group blank)
and assign an appropriate priority score.
<H2>Getting the Source Code</H2>
<p>
<a href="http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/OBO-Edit:_Getting_the_Source_Code">This wiki page</a> describes how to download, compile, and run the OBO-Edit source code.  If you are familiar with Java, getting the source code may help you track down and perhaps even work around a bug.</p>
