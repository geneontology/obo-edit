<p>In OBO-Edit the layout of the various tabs in the interface is controlled by
the Perspectives feature. Using this feature you can drag tabs around the
interface to a location that is more convenient. The tabs will automatically
slot into the place where you drop them. You can remove them from the main
interface to be in a window on their own by clicking the little icon of an
arrow that points upwards and to the right. To return the tab to within the
main application window click the icon of an arrow that points downwards and
to the left.
</p></p>
To access the menus options for perspectives select [View]->[Layouts].
</p></p>
There are two built-in perspectives called Edit and Verify. The Edit perspective
is optimized for ontology editing, and the Verify perspective allows you to
easily check various features of the ontology such as comment syntax.
</p></p>
In addition to these built-in perspectives you may create your own favourite perspective, save it,
and mail the configuration file round to your colleagues. To do this, first
set up the perspective by dragging the tabs around. Then save the
perspective. Then go to the .oboedit directory (current this is .oboeditbeta
but it won't be once the tool is released) and look inside the perspectives
directory. The details of your layout are held within a file in this
folder. It is not possible to edit this file by hand, but you can mail the
file around to let others use your favourite perspective. They simply need to
add your file to their .oboedit/perspectives directory.
