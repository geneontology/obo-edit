<h1>The OBO Adapter</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Reads 
and writes files in the <A href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm">OBO flat 
file format</A>. All versions of the OBO format are supported. Files 
can be read from disk or a URL, but files must be written to disk.</p>
<p><strong>Supported features:</strong> The OBO Adapter can save two different version of the flat file 
specification, OBO 1.0 and OBO 1.2. The two versions support slightly different 
ontology features.</p>
<p><em>OBO 1.2</em> - This format can save the entire contents of an OBO-Edit 
ontology, no matter what features are used.</p>
<p><em>OBO 1.0</em> - OBO 1.0 does not support:</p>
<ul>
  <li>synonym types
  <li>obsolete replacement
  <li>instances
  <li>non-class domain/range specifiers
  <li>some uses of union_of and disjoint_from</li></ul>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<h3>Basic Operation</h3>
<p>The OBO Flat File adapter's basic mode conforms to the interface described 
in&nbsp;<A href="The_Basic_Flat_File_Interface.htm">The Basic Flat File 
Interface</A>.</p>
<h3>Advanced Operation</h3>
<h4>Loading</h4>
<p>When the "Advanced" button is pressed, the load dialog 
changes to look like this:</p>
<p><IMG height=285 hspace=0 src="../images/load_obo_advanced.gif" width=554 
border=0></p>
<p>This interface allows fine control over which files are loaded. The list to 
the left contains all the files to be loaded by the OBO Adapter.</p>
<p>To edit a file in the list, left-click the file to select it. The file will 
be loaded into an editor to the right:</p>
<p><IMG height=275 hspace=0 src="../images/load_obo_editor.gif" width=553 
border=0></p>
<p>To change the path, type a new path into the text box, or select a file from 
the disk by clicking the "Browse..." button.</p>
<p>To add a new file path, press the "Add" button. A new path will appear with 
the path set to "&lt;new path&gt;". Edit the path as described above.</p>
<p>To delete a path, select it from the list and press the "Del" button.</p>
<p>The "Allow dangling references" box enables the OBO Adapter to load 
ontologies that contain dangling references. (Note:  as of April 2008, this is
  now the default.)  Dangling references occur when an 
ontology term contains a link to a term that does not exist. This can happen if 
an ontology contains links to another ontology, but the second ontology is not 
loaded.</p>
<p>If dangling references are loaded, OBO-Edit records the references and writes 
them out when the file is saved. The dangling references cannot be changed or 
deleted within the normal OBO-Edit interface (although external plugins may 
allow you to edit the references).</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h1>I Can't See the Add/Del/Whatever button!</h1>
<hr>
<p class="sidebar">Many OBO-Edit controls (like all editable 
lists) contain a resizable divider. Some platforms (&lt;cough&gt; 
&lt;Macintosh!&gt;) have odd ideas about how to initially place these dividers. 
Sometimes this means that a divider starts so far over to the left that a button 
is initially hidden. This most often affects the "Del" button of an editable 
list.</p>
<p class="sidebar">We're actively seeking a cure for this problem. Until then, try 
resizing a divider if some controls are hidden.</p>
</div>

<h4>Saving</h4>
<p>When the "Advanced" button is pressed, the save dialog changes to look like 
this:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/save_obo_advanced.png" 
border=0></p>
<p>The dropdown box at the top of the dialog selects which version of the OBO 
format to use. The default in OBO-Edit 2 is OBO version 1.2.</p>
<p>The OBO Adapter can save an ontology to several different files. The contents 
of the save files may overlap, or may be entirely disjoint. The save can be 
configured so that some terms or links don't get saved at all.</p>
<p>The list to the left contains all the files that will be saved. To add a new 
save file, press the "Add" button. A new file will be created&nbsp;with the 
path&nbsp;"&lt;new save path&gt;".</p>
<p>To delete a save file, click it to select the file, and press the "Del" 
button.</p>
<p>To edit a save file, click it to select the file. An editor will appear to 
the right of the file list that looks like this:</p>
<p><IMG src="../images/obo-write-advanced.png" border=0></p>
<p>At the top is is a dropdown labeled "Output type". This dropdown
allows the user to select whether to save in OBO 1.0 or OBO 1.2
format.</p>
<p>Next is a line at the top contains the path of the save file. To
change the save path, type a new path into the text box or click the
Browse button to select a file from the disk as a save location.</p>
<p>The middle rows of controls contains filtering settings. These are very 
important, and are addressed in their own section below.</p>
<p><A name=implied_links></A>Below the filtering controls is a
checkbox labeled "Save implied links". If this box is selected,
implied links that were generated by a reasoner&nbsp;will be included
in the save file. When implied links are saved, a dropdown box is
enabled that specifies <em>how</em> the implied links should be
saved. The possible settings are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Save for presentation</strong> - Saves the links that would appear 
  in the OBO-Edit interface. Most links generated by the reasoner are not useful 
  to users and are not shown in the interface. "Save for presentation" only 
  saves those non-hidden links. For more information on which links are hidden 
  and which are not, see <A href="The_Reasoner_and_the_Interface.htm">The 
  Reasoner and the Interface</A>. 
  <li><strong>Save all links</strong> - Saves every link inferred by the 
  reasoner. This will be a very, <strong>very</strong> large number of links, 
  most of which will not be useful to users. This mode should only be used for 
  populating a database or other tasks where every bit of data is needed.</li></ul> 
  <p>If the "Realize implied links" checkbox, implied links will 
  be stripped of the label that identifies them as reasoner-generated links. These implied links will be 
  saved as if they were regular links created by a human user.</p>
<p>   On the next line&nbsp;is a dropdown box containing the id generation 
rules settings. OBO files can store certain kinds of id generation rules. This 
box specifies which id rules (if any) to write for this file. There are three 
settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Don't write id rules</strong> - No id rules are written to the file 
  <li><strong>Write current id rules</strong> -&nbsp;Writes the&nbsp;current id 
  rules (specified in <A href="The_ID_Manager_Plugin.htm">the ID Manager</A>) 
  <li><strong>Write originally loaded id rules</strong> - Writes the rules that 
  were originally loaded with this ontology (if there were any)</li></ul> 
  <p>To the right of all these controls is the OBO File Remark 
text field. This field will be converted into a comment in the OBO file header. 
Note that even though text wraps in this field, 
  the wrapping will not be preserved in the OBO file.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering Output Files<a 
name="filtering"></a>  </strong></p>
<p>The contents of the saved files can be controlled by the use of filters. To 
filter an ontology, click the "Filter terms" or "Filter links" checkboxes. 
Filter editors will appear, and the interface will look like this:</p>
<p><IMG src="../images/obo-write-advanced-filter.png" border=0></p>
<p>If "Filter terms" is checked, a term filter editor appears. If "Filter links" 
is checked, a link filter editor appears. If both are checked, a term filter 
editor and link filter editor appear. There is a small label above each to 
indicate which is which.  Note that you may need to expand the window
in order to see the filter editors.</p>
<p>The filter editors are configured as described in the <A 
href="Term_Filters.htm">Term Filters</A>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<A 
href="Link_Filters.htm">Link Filters</A>&nbsp;section.</p>
<p>When link filtering is enabled, only links that match the filter will be 
written to the file. When term filtering is enabled, only term that match the 
filter will be written to the file. If term filtering is enabled and link 
filtering is not, if a term does not match the filter, no links to that term 
will be written to the file.</p>
<p><em>But</em>, if term filtering and link filtering are enabled and a term 
does not match the filter, the term is not written, but <em>links to that term 
can be written</em>. To write these dangling links to the file, click the "Allow 
dangling parents" checkbox. If the checkbox is not selected, the dangling links 
will not be written out.</p>
<P>If the "Always save properties" box is checked, the term filter will be 
extended so that it properties are always saved, even if the term filter would 
normally drop them. This is done by changing your specified filter into <FONT 
face=Courier>[Self] [Is Property] OR &lt;your filter&gt;. </FONT><FONT 
face=Arial>Note that this has no effect on link filtering at all. If you are 
doing link filtering, make sure to take steps to preserve links between 
properties or they will be lost.</FONT></P>
<P>If the "Do type prefiltering" box is checked, a dropdown will be enabled that 
allows the user to select a pre-filter property. The pre-filter will be applied 
before the ontology is saved. See <A href="Reasoner_Prefilters.htm">Reasoner 
Prefilters</A> for more information.</P>
<P>If the "Discard unused categories" box is checked, <A 
href="Working_with_Synonym_Categories.htm">Synonym Types</A> and <A 
href="Working_with_Categories.htm">Subsets</A> that are not used in the 
ontology after filtering is applied will not appear in the file header. This 
option is only available if filtering, link filtering or prefiltering is 
enabled.</P>
<P>The "Root selection algorithm" dropdown allows the user 
to choose a root selection algorithm to use when filtering the saved file. See 
<A href="Filtering.htm#root_picking">Orphaned Terms and the Root Picking 
Algorithm</A>            
      &nbsp;for more information. </P>
<p> 
  Once all your save files have been configured, press the ok 
button to save. </p>

<h1>Tips for a Successful Filtered Save</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Filters are always a little tricky to design. The easiest way to design a 
save filter is to use the OBO-Edit&nbsp;<A href="Filtering.htm">filtering</A> 
interface to design the filter and test it on the currently loaded 
ontology.&nbsp;When the filter is working correctly, save it (see <A 
href="Reusing_Filters.htm">Reusing Filters</A> for information on how to save 
and load filters), bring up the advanced OBO adapter save dialog, and load the 
saved filter using the <IMG  hspace=0 
src="../images/filter_load_save_buttons.png"  border=0> &nbsp;buttons.
