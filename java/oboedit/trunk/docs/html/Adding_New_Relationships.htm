<h1>Adding New Relationships</h1>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by</strong>: Drag-and-drop, right-click</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: C, Shift+C, P, Shift+P</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: One or more source relationships required</p>
<P><STRONG>Target requirement</STRONG>: One target required</P>
</div>
<p>New relationships can be added by drag-and-drop, or via the right-click 
menu.</p>
<p>To create one or more new relationships, select a collection of source 
relationships that you would like to relate to a new term. Then, select a target 
term to which they will be related by right-clicking the target term or by 
drag-and-drop.</p>
<p>From the right-click menu or the drag and drop popup menu, you may add new 
relationships using the "Add parent term" or "Add child term" menu options. Note 
that the names of these operations refer to changes that will occur to the 
<strong>target</strong> term. So if you drag term A onto term B and choose "Add 
parent term", A will become a new parent of B.</p>
<p>Both the "Add parent term" and "Add child term" menu items have a flyout 
submenu of the relationship type that should be used when creating the new 
relationship:</p>

<p>Select the relationship type you would like for the new 
relationship, and it will be created. If you would like the new relationship to 
use the same relationship type as the original source relationship, use the "Use 
original type" menu option. This is particularly useful if you are creating 
several relationships at once by using a number of source relationships. If "Use 
original type" is used with untyped source relationships (ie one or more of your 
sources is an ontology root) the <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> relationship is used.</p>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
<p> When dragging, you can use hotkeys to specify the "Add parent term" or 
"Add child term" edit operations. To specify "Add child term", hold down the "C" 
key on the keyboard while dragging. The title above the terms you are dragging 
will change from "Dragging" to "Add child...":</p>

width=288 border=0></p>
<p>When the term is dropped, the type selection menu will 
pop up.</p>
<p>To specify "Add parent term", hold down the "P" key on 
the keyboard while dragging. The title above the terms you are dragging will 
change from "Dragging" to "Add parent..."</p>
<p>Further, if you are holding down the "C" or "P" 
keys&nbsp;while dragging, you can hold down the "Shift" key to indicate that you 
wish to use the "Use original type" option when assigning relationship types for 
the newly created relationships. The phrase "(original type)" will appear in the 
title bar above the dragged terms. When the terms are dropped, no menus will 
appear at all; the new parents or children will be added immediately.</p>

<h1>Where did the "copy" menu item go?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Long-time users of DAG-Edit might be wondering where the "Copy" menu item 
went.&nbsp;The "Add parent term" and "Add child term" menu items have replaced 
"copy". In fact, "Add 
child term" does exactly the same thing as the old "Copy" menu item.
</p>
<p>We originally called this operation "Copy" because it made a term appear in 
the graph more than once; a "copy" was created. Over time, we realized that 
"Copy" was a misleading name. Many new users of DAG-Edit thought that an 
entirely new term was being generated.</p>
