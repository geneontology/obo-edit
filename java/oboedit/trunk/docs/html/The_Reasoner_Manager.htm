<h1>The Reasoner Manager</h1>
<p>The reasoner is activated and deactivated via the 
Reasoner Manager.
You can turn on the reasoner in OBO-Edit by showing the Reasoner Manager ([Reasoner] -> [Reasoner Manager]) and selecting a reasoner from the
pulldown list.  (Once you make your choice, you can get rid of the Reasoner Manager panel
and the reasoner selection will stay as you left it.)
<p>OBO-Edit offers a choice of reasoners.  The current options are
  ForwardChainingReasoner and LinkPileReasoner.  ForwardChainingReasoner,
  which was the default reasoner in OBO-Edit before March 2008, is faster but
  not as complete, and will be phased out.
LinkPileReasoner is currently
  very slow, but more complete.

<h1>Wait... Did I Leave the Reasoner On?</h1>
<hr>

<p>     Like most components, the Reasoner Manager remembers its state when OBO-Edit is exited. This 
means that if the reasoner is on when you exit OBO-Edit, 
it will be on the next time you start OBO-Edit.  The entire application runs more slowly when the reasoner is running, so 
enable it with caution.</p><p>
When one of the reasoners is turned on, the titlebar of the OBO-Edit window says
  "(REASONER ON)" as a visual reminder.  The reasoner causes some
operations in OBO-Edit to take longer, so you may want to turn it off if you
don't need it.</p>
