<h1>The Reasoner Manager</h1>
<p>The reasoner is activated and deactivated via the 
Reasoner Manager.
You can turn on the reasoner in OBO-Edit by showing the Reasoner Manager ([Reasoner] -> [Reasoner Manager]) and selecting a reasoner from the
pulldown list.  Once you make your choice, you can get rid of the Reasoner Manager panel
and the reasoner selection will stay as you left it. However, because the
reasoner uses so much memory, it is generally a good idea to turn it on only
when you really need it, and turn it off when you're done.  Be sure to save your work
<b>before</b> you turn on the reasoner, in case OBO-Edit runs out of memory
and dies.

<h1>Wait... Did I Leave the Reasoner On?</h1>
<hr>

<p>Like most OBO-Edit components, the Reasoner Manager remembers its state when OBO-Edit is exited. This 
means that if the reasoner is on when you exit OBO-Edit, 
it will be on the next time you start OBO-Edit.  The entire application runs
  more slowly when the reasoner is running, so usually it makes sense to turn
  off the reasoner before you exit OBO-Edit (you can always turn it back on
  next time if you need it).
  </p><p>
When the reasoner is turned on, the titlebar of the OBO-Edit window says
  "(REASONER ON)" as a visual reminder.</p>
