<H1>Basic Concepts and Vocabulary</H1>
<P>This guide uses both technical jargon (of which some is commonly used in the formal ontology field, 
and some is fairly specific to OBO-Edit) and vocabulary that is more 
intuitive to biologists. Technical terms and their synonyms may be used in a 
single sentence.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Classes/Terms </STRONG>- 
  Classes (often called terms) are the concepts described by your ontology. See 
  <A href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm#classes">An Introduction to OBO 
  Ontologies</A> for a detailed discussion of exactly what classes are. For now, 
  realize that they're probably the part of your ontology that you really care 
  about.
They are the entities that you want to classify or processes you want to relate
  to one another. Anatomical structures and biological processes are examples.
  <LI><STRONG>Relations/Relationship types</STRONG> - Relations (often called 
  relationship types in this guide) describe the relationships between terms. 
  <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> and <STRONG>part_of</STRONG> are both types of relations. See <A 
  href="An_Introduction_to_OBO_Ontologies.htm#relations" >An Introduction to OBO 
  Ontologies</A>            
           for a more detailed 
  discussion.
  <LI><STRONG>Links/Relationships</STRONG> - When two terms 
  have a relationship to one another, that relationship is called a 
  "relationship" (surprise!). A relationship in OBO-Edit consists of a child 
  term, a relationship type, and a parent term. Relationships are directional: 
  the child term has a relationship of the given type to the parent term. 
  Because a relationship indicates a directional connection between two terms, 
  they are sometimes called "links" in this document.</LI></UL>
