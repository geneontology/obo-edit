<H1>Global Filters &amp; Renderers</H1>

<P>You may want to apply a filter or renderer to all ontology 
editor panels all the time. OBO-Edit allows you to create <EM>global 
filters</EM> and <EM>global renderers</EM> using the Global Filters panel.</P>
<P>Global filters and renderers are applied to every ontology editor
panel automatically. Global filters and renderers are not affected by
the filtering and rendering options available in the component
configuration for an ontology editor panel.

<H2>The Global Filters Panel</H2>
<P>To&nbsp;edit the&nbsp;global filters, choose Global Filters 
from the Config menu:</P>

border=0>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are four tabs at the top of the plugin, allowing you to edit
global <strong>term filters, link filters, term renderers</strong> and
<strong>link renderers</strong> .

<H3>Editing Global Filters</H3>

<P>To edit global filters, click the "Term Filters" or "Link Filters"
tab. The screenshot above shows the "Term Filters" tab. The "Link
Filters" list contains all the global link filters, and the "Term
filters" list contains all the global term filters.</P>

<P>To edit a filter, simply change its search criteria (see <a
href="Advanced_Searching.htm">Advanced Searching</a> for how to do
this).</p>

<P>To add a filter, click the "+" button at the bottom of the panel. A
new filter will be created that can be edited as described above.</P>
<P>To delete a filter, click the "-" button at the right.</P>

<H3>Editing Global Renderers</H3>
<P>To edit global renderers, click the "Term Renderers" or "Link Renderers" tab; the screenshot shows the "Term Renderers" tab:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/global_filter_renderers.png" 
 border=0></P>

<P> The "Term Renderers" list contains all the global term renderers,
and the "Link Renderers" list contains all the default link
renderers.</P>

<P>To edit a renderer, select it by double-clicking its description in
the list. A renderer designer will appear where you can edit the
renderer.  Note that between the renderer list and the renderer
designer, the interface may need a lot of space on the screen for all
the controls to be visible. Resize the panel if necessary to see all
the controls.</P>

<P>To add a renderer, click the "+" button under the renderer list. A new 
renderer will be created that can be edited as described above.</P>
<P>To delete a renderer, select the renderer to delete and click the "-" 
button under the renderer list.</P>

<H2>Default Global Filters &amp; Renderers</H2>
<P>When OBO-Edit is first installed, the following global filters and renderers 
are installed by default (note that these default filters and renderers are 
described in terms of their effects. The actual filter definitions tend to be 
more complex than these descriptions):</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Default Term Filters</STRONG>
  <UL>
    <LI>Don't show built-in objects that are not relations (e.g.,
    obo:datatype)</LI>
  </UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Default Link Filters</STRONG>
  <UL>
    <LI>Don't show links that define an intersection (aka complete 
links)</LI>
<!--     <li>Don't show links unless the link type is transitive -->
  </UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Default Term Renderers</STRONG>
  <UL>
    <LI>Show obsolete terms in red, and with strikeout
    <LI>Show relations in blue</LI>
  </UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Default Link Renderers</STRONG>
  <UL>
    <LI>Show the arrows of redundant links in red, and zigzagged
    <LI>Show the arrows of implied links in blue</LI>
  </UL>
