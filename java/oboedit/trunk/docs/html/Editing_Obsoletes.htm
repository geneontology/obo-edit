<h1>Editing Obsoletes</h1>

<p>An obsolete term is one that is no longer used, and has been
"deleted" from the ontology. When a term (or relation or instance) is
removed from active use, the term does not vanish; instead, it is
marked obsolete. This ensures that the obsolete term's ID is tracked
and not reused for a different term.</p>

<p>To make a term obsolete, simply <a href="Deleting.htm">delete</a>
all of its relationships to other terms in the ontology.</p>

<p>Once a term is obsolete, most of its attributes cannot be
edited. Obsolete terms cannot have relationships to other terms, and
most text attributes of obsolete terms cannot be modified.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to edit the definition and comments of an
obsolete term. To edit an obsolete term, select it and follow the
editing instructions described in the <a href="Text_Editing.htm">Text
Editing</a> section of this guide. Editing controls for uneditable
attributes will be disabled.</p>

<p>OBO-Edit provides a mechanism to specify terms that can be used
(e.g. in annotations or mappings) in place of obsolete terms. See <a
href="Assigning_Replacement_Terms.htm">Assigning Replacement Terms</a>
for more information.</p>
