<H1>Link Filters</H1>
<P>Link filters are used to pick certain links between 
terms from a collection of links between terms. Note that links are 
<EM>different kinds of objects</EM> than terms. Links represent relationships 
between terms.</P>
<P>In this guide, links are usually written in the form</P>
<P><EM>child_term</EM> -<STRONG>relation</STRONG>-&gt; <EM>parent_term</EM></P>
<P>So if there is an <STRONG>is_a</STRONG> relationship between "heart 
development" and "development", that link would be written as</P>
<P>"heart development" -<STRONG>is_a</STRONG>-&gt; "development"</P>
<H2>The Link Filter Interface</H2>
<P>To add or change link filters in a user configurable filter 
designer (such as the Global Filters component), click the "Link filters" tab
<P>The link filter interface looks like this:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/filter_link.png" border=0></P>
<P>Notice the field that says "Self". This is called the "link facet".
Other than this new field, the link 
filter interface looks exactly like the term filter interface.</P>
<P>The link facet determines what characteristics of the link will be considered 
when filtering. There are 4 possible link facets:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Child</STRONG> - This 
  link facet indicates that the link should be filtered based on the attributes 
  of the link's child term. If this facet is selected, the rest of the filter 
  simply specifies the search criteria to apply to the child term. 
  <LI><STRONG>Type</STRONG> - This 
  link facet indicates that the link should be filtered based on the attributes 
  of the link's type (aka relation). If this facet is selected, the rest of the 
  filter specifies search criteria to apply to the link type. 
  <LI><STRONG>Parent</STRONG> - This 
  link facet indicates that the link should be filtered based on the attributes 
  of the link's parent term (aka relation). If this facet is selected, the rest 
  of the filter specifies search criteria to apply to the link parent. 
  <LI><STRONG>Self</STRONG> - This facet indicates that the link should be 
  filtered based on attributes of the link itself. If this facet is selected, 
  the rest of the filter specifies special, link-specific search 
attributes.</LI></UL>

<P>If any of the first three facets (<STRONG>child, type,</STRONG> or
<STRONG>parent</STRONG>) are selected, the filter behaves just like a
term filter (see <a href="Building_a_Filter.htm">Building Filters</a>
and <a href="Term_Filters.htm">Term Filters</a> for more
information). The <STRONG>have/don't have</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Aspect</STRONG>, <STRONG>Attribute</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Comparison</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Value</STRONG> fields are
specified to select the desired terms, and the links whose appropriate
facets match the filter will be matched.</P>

<P>If the <STRONG>Self</STRONG> facet is selected, however, a special set of 
link-specific attributes becomes available.</P>
<H2>Link-Specific Attributes</H2>
<P>The following attributes are available when the <STRONG>Self</STRONG> facet 
has been selected:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Namespace</STRONG> 
  <EM>(single text value</EM>) - Searches the namespace of the 
  link itself (NOT the namespace of the child, type or parent term). See <A 
  href="Parent_Editor.htm">The Parent_Editor</A> and <A 
  href="Changing_Link_Attributes.htm">Changing Link Attributes</A> for 
  information on setting the namespace of a link.
  <LI><STRONG>Is intersection</STRONG> <EM>(boolean value)</EM> - Whether this link has been 
  marked an intersection link. See <A 
  href="Introduction_to_Cross_Products.htm">Cross Products</A> for 
  information on intersection links.
  <LI><STRONG>Is necessary</STRONG> <EM>(boolean value)</EM> - Whether this link 
  has been marked necessarily true. See <A href="Parent_Editor.htm">The 
  Parent_Editor</A> and <A href="Changing_Link_Attributes.htm">Changing Link 
  Attributes</A> for more information.
  <LI><STRONG>Is implied</STRONG> <EM>(boolean value)</EM> - Whether this is an implied link. 
  Links may be marked implied when they are loaded (if they were loaded by a 
  reasoner-generated file), but most of the time implied links have been created 
  by the OBO-Edit reasoner. This kind of implied link will only exist if the 
  reasoner is enabled. When searching, this attribute will only find implied 
  links that have not been <A 
  href="The_Reasoner_and_the_Interface.htm#trimming">trimmed</A>. See <A href="The_OBO_Edit_Reasoner.htm">The 
  OBO-Edit Reasoner</A> for more information.
  <LI><STRONG>Is redundant</STRONG> <EM>(boolean value)</EM> - Whether this is a 
  redundant link. The OBO-Edit reasoner may mark a user-created link redundant 
  if it reiterates information implied by other links in the ontology. Links 
  will only be marked redundant if the reasoner is enabled. See <A 
  href="The_OBO_Edit_Reasoner.htm#redundant" >The OBO-Edit Reasoner</A> for more 
  information.</LI></UL>
<H2>Special Behavior of the Search Aspect</H2>
<P>If the <STRONG>Self</STRONG> facet is selected, search aspects work a little 
differently. In a term filter, the search aspect specifies an alternate 
collection of related terms to find a match. In a link filter, the search aspect 
specifies an alternate collection of related <EM>links</EM>.</P>
<P>For example, when the <STRONG>Self</STRONG> aspect is selected, the 
ancestor aspect searches all the ancestor <EM>links</EM> (NOT ancestor terms) to 
find a match.</P>

<h1>A global link filter that seems like a good idea but slows everything down</h1>
<hr>
<p>
If your ontology has a lot of "disjoint_from" links, the graph display can
become rather tangled, so it might occur to you to add a link filter to hide
those links:  "Select links where Type that don't have a ID that equals the value
disjoint_from"
or, in the syntax at the bottom of the link search panel, <code>link.type(id NOT equals "disjoint_from")</code>.
</p>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/disjoint-from-link-filter.png" border=0></P>
<p>The problem with this link filter is that any time you perform an ontology
edit (for example, using the Text Editor to change the wording of a definition
or add a dbxref), OBO-Edit runs all the link filters, and this "disjoint_from"
filter is very expensive to perform.  You will thus see very slow editing
performance--for example, with this filter in place, a text edit of the GO
ontology takes 13 seconds to commit.  We suggest that you use this filter only
when necessary, and don't save it as a global link filter that will be applied
every time you open OBO-Edit.
