<h1>The Graph Viewer Panel</h1>
<p>The Graph Viewer Panel is not included in the default layouts.  
You can bring it up via its menu item: [Viewers] -> [Graph Viewer].
(Note that this component used to be called the Graph DAG View.)

<h3>Path To Root</h3>
<p>
To see the full path to root in this component you must always run the reasoner. When the reasoner is turned on, the graph representation in image A 
will be modified to that shown in image B. 
<p><strong>Image A</strong></p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/graph_viewer_no_res.png" border=0></p>
<p><strong>Image B</strong></p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/graph_viewer_res.png" border=0></p>
<h3>Zooming and Panning</h3>
<p>To zoom in and out on this tool you can drag the blue dot up and down on the zoom scale.</p>

<p>To pan around on the image and examine different branches you can click anywhere in the window and drag your mouse. </p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The Graph Viewer has a number of configurable options. These are accessed via the wrench icon.</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/graph_viewer_config.png" border=0></p>

<h3>Display Some or All Relationship Types</h3>
<p>By selecting <strong>Show all types panel</strong> you can ensure that the viewer will display the graph with all relationships types. </p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/graph_viewer_all_types.png" border=0></p>
<p>Alternatively you can select <strong>Show per-type panels</strong> to show one panel for each relationship type in the graph. In this case other relationships
will also be filled in where necessary to complete the graph structure to the root. </p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/graph_viewer_per_types.png" border=0></p>
<p>Selecting both of these options will cause the window to show both sets of views side by side. </p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/graph_viewer_all_types_per_types.png" border=0></p>

<h3>Animate</h3>
<p>Checking the animate option will slow down the redraw of the panel so that you can see the terms slide around to their new positions on screen. Unchecking
this option causes redraw to speed up so that now motion of the terms will be discernable in the transition between the view of one set of terms and the next.</p>
