<h1>Advanced Searching</h1>
<p>
The Search Panel interface allows the user to do compound
searches. A simple search with only one criterion looks like this:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%201.png" alt=""></p><p>
In this case only terms with names that equal 'development' will be
found. </p><p>
The text field provides an autocompletion feature:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2027.png" alt=""></p><p>
The dropdown menus provide a range of options for searching. </p><p>
The first menu on the left allows you to choose whether the terms found
will have, or not have, the criterion described:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%205.png" alt=""></p><p>
The next menu allows you to choose which field or fields will be
searched:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2034.png" alt=""></p><p>
The menu on the right allows you to choose how the contents of the
field will relate to the search string. </p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2010.png" alt=""></p><p>
This button <img src="search/Picture%2018.png" alt=""> allows you to choose
whether the search string will find a match to a given term itself, or
to the ancestor, descendent, or root of the term found:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2035.png" alt=""></p><p>
It is possible to stipulate further criteria by clicking:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2017.png" alt=""></p><p>
This produces a new line with the same set of dropdown menus, and field
to fill in your search string:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2011.png" alt=""></p><p>
to delete this line again click:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2020.png" alt=""></p><p>
Once we have more than one row like this we can make AND/OR queries
using this control:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2025.png" alt=""></p><p>
In the above compound query you can see that we are searching for terms
that match both criteria (AND query), as the 'matches all' radio button
is selected. However, if the 'matches any' radio button was selected
then we would find all terms that matches one or other criteria
regardless of whether they matches both (OR query). </p><p>
It is also possible to add further layers of complexity as follows
using the&nbsp; <img src="search/Picture%2017.png" alt=""> and <img
 src="search/Picture%2020.png" alt=""> buttons. </p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2012.png" alt=""></p><p>
In this case we will find all terms that have a name that contains the
word 'development', in addition to having either the string 'R6' in the
name field, or the string 'R8' in any text field. </p><p>
There can be many levels in the search:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2013.png" alt=""></p><p>
To move any individual criterion in the search into or out of a given
level of nesting the&nbsp; <img src="search/Picture%2023.png" alt=""> and <img
 src="search/Picture%2019.png" alt=""> buttons are used.</p><p>
Selecting <img src="search/Picture%2026.png" alt=""> causes a <img
 src="search/Picture%2021.png" alt=""> icon to appear. </p><p>
If the term selected in
the ontology editor panel fits the criterion next to the lightbulb icon</p><p>
&nbsp;then the icon turns yellow: <img src="search/Picture%2022.png" alt=""></p><p>
If the term does not match then the lightbulb stays white as shown
below:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2016.png" alt=""></p><p>
The result of a query is displayed in a list, with obsolete terms in
red and crossed out:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2032.png" alt=""></p><p>
To select a terms of interest in the Ontology Editor Panel you can just
click on the term in the search results list. </p><p>
If you have performed multiple searches then you can scroll through the
various tabs using the left and right arrows, or see a vertical list by
using the button on the right of the arrows:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2033.png" alt=""></p><p>
<h1>Link Search</h1>
The link search panel ([Search] -> [Link Search]) allows you to search on relationship criteria rather
text fields. </p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2039.png" alt=""></p><p>
The interface looks very similar to the term search but has some
differences as follows:</p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2036.png" alt=""></p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2041.png" alt=""></p><p>
<img src="search/Picture%2038.png" alt=""></p><p>
Is redundant - Allows you to search for redundant links in the
ontology, which can then be deleted. </p>
