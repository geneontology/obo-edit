<H1>Searching</H1>

<P>The main use of filters is for searching. An OBO-Edit search checks
every term or link in the ontology to see if it matches the given filter.
When the search is complete, a list of matching terms is displayed to
the user.</P>

<h2>Term Searches</h2>
<P>The OBO-Edit term search panel looks like this:</P>
<P><IMG src="../images/filter_term_standard.png" border=0></P>
<P>To do a search, first use the filter designer to create 
the filter you want to use. Then click the "Search" button.</P>
<P>When the search is complete, a list of results will appear and a
new tab will be added to the search interface. Term search results
consist of a list of matching terms. Each term's name and id is
listed:</P>

<p><img hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_term.png" border=0></p>

<P>The search results appear at the top of the tab. To sort the search
results by a particular field (e.g., ID), click the appropriate header
at the top of the search column. Clicking again will reverse-sort by
the same column.</P>

<P>Click a search result to select it. The search result will
automatically be selected in any panel set to global selection
mode.</P>

<p>Each search result panel behaves as a <a
href="Components.htm">component</a> and can be handled separately; by
default, new search results panels appear docked behind the search
panel.</p>

<H2>Link Searches</H2>
<P>You can do a link search by choosing "Link Search Panel" from the "Search" menu.
Link search results consist of a list of matching links. For each link, the 
child id, child name, type id, parent id, and parent name are listed:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_link.png" border=0></P>

<p>As with term search results, link search results appear in tabs
that behave as components, and the results can be sorted by clicking
the headers. Clicking on a link in the list selects it in panels in
global selection mode; note that because each result is a link, no
selection will appear in the Text Editor.</p>

<h2>Configuring Search Results Headers</h2>
<p>
To control what information appears at the top of each search result panel, click the wrench icon. A configuration panel appears:
</p>
<p><img hspace=0 src="../images/search_panel_config.png" border=0></p>

<p>Check the first box to show the words "Search results:" at the top. Use the pulldown to select whether to show the number of matches ("Result Count"), the search parameters ("Query Expression") or no additional text.
</p>

<h2>Saving Search Results to a File</h2>
<p>
You can save just the ontology terms that matched a particular search. The
way to do this is with a <a href="Loading___Saving.htm#filter">filtered save</a>.
