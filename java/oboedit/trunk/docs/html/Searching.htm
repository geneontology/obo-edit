<H1>Searching</H1>
<P>The main use of filters is for searching. An OBO-Edit 
search checks every term in the ontology to see if it matches the given filter. 
When the search is complete, a list of matching terms 
is displayed to the user.</P>
<P>The OBO-Edit term search panel looks like this:</P>
<P><IMG src="../images/filter_term_standard.png" border=0></P>
<P>To do a search, first use the filter designer to create 
the filter you want to use. Then click the "Search" button.</P>
<P>When the search is complete, a list of results will appear and a new tab will 
be added to the search interface:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_term.png" border=0></P>
<P>The search results appear at the top of the tab. To sort the search results
by a particular field (e.g., ID), click the appropriate header at the top of
  the search column.  Clicking again will reverse-sort by the same column.</P>
<P>Click a search result to select it. If "Autoselect" is clicked, the search 
result will automatically be selected in the primary ontology editor panel (it is 
possible to specify a different ontology editor panel where search results will be 
selected; see below). </P>
<P>There are a number of controls at the bottom of the results panel:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><IMG height=23 hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_autoselect.gif" 
  width=75 border=0>&nbsp;- If 
  this&nbsp;box is&nbsp;checked, terms will automatically be selected in the 
  ontology editor panel when they are selected in the search results panel 
  <LI><IMG height=23 hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_selectbutton.gif" 
  width=94 border=0>&nbsp;- When this button 
  is pressed, the currently selected search results are selected in the ontology 
  editor panel. This button is only useful if the autoselect box 
  is&nbsp;disabled. 
  <LI><IMG height=26 hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_label.gif" width=152 
  border=0>&nbsp;- If you've 
  done&nbsp;several searches, you may want to label your search results with a 
  more descriptive title. To change the label, enter a new value in the text 
  box, and then press enter. 
  <LI><IMG height=26 hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_detachbutton.gif" 
  width=50 border=0>&nbsp;-&nbsp;When 
  this button is pressed, the search results will be&nbsp;detached from the 
  main&nbsp;tab panel and placed in a free floating window. Press the button 
  again to reattach the results to the tab&nbsp;pane. 
  <LI><IMG height=26 hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_closebutton.gif" 
  width=50 border=0>&nbsp;- This button closes the results panel and removes the 
  search results.</LI></UL>
<H2>Term Search Results vs. Link Search Results</H2>
<P>Term search results consist of a list of matching terms. Each term's name and 
id is listed:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_term.png" border=0></P>
<P>
You can do a link search by choosing "Link Search Panel" from the "Search" menu.
Link search results consist of a list of matching links. For each link, the 
child id, child name, type id, parent id, and parent name are listed:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/search_results_link.png" border=0></P>

<H2>Selecting Search Results</H2>
<P>As noted earlier, if a search result is clicked and the autoselect box is 
checked, or the "Select terms" button is pressed, the search result is selected 
in the ontology editor panel.  The shortest path to the search result is shown.</P>
<P>Normally, search results are selected in the primary ontology editor panel (see 
<A href="The_Term_Editor_Panel.htm">The ontology editor panel</A> for information 
about designating the primary ontology editor panel). Search results can be selected 
in a different ontology editor panel by dragging the search button onto the desired 
ontology editor panel instead of clicking the buttons.</P>

<h2>Saving Search Results to a File</h2>
<p>
You can save just the ontology terms that matched a particular search.  The
way to do this is with a <a href="Loading___Saving.htm#filter">filtered save</a>.
