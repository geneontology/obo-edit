<h1>Filters</h1>
<P>OBO-Edit filters allow you to specify some subset of an 
ontology. A filter might be able to pick out all the terms in the ontology that 
have "kinase" in their name, or find every link in the ontology whose 
relationship type is <EM>part_of</EM>             
                
            . 
</P>
<P>If a&nbsp;term or link belongs to the subset that a filter specifies, the 
term or link is said to <STRONG>match</STRONG> 
the filter. For example, if we create a filter&nbsp;for terms whose 
name contains the word "kinase", that filter would match "fructokinase activity" 
but not "fructose-biophosphatase activity".&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once a filter has been created, there are a number of things you can do with 
it. Filters can be used to <A href="Searching.htm">search</A> an ontology, 
resulting in a list of matching terms and links.&nbsp;A filter can be used to 
create a custom <A href="Rendering.htm">renderer</A> for an ontology, resulting 
in special coloring or fonts for matching terms and links. Or, a filter can be 
used to <A href="Filtering.htm">filter</A>&nbsp;an ontology so that&nbsp;terms 
or links that don't match the filter are hidden in the ontology editor 
panel.</P>
