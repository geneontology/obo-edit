<h1>Adding New Terms and Properties</h1>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>When adding a new class 
(or property, or any other item with an identifier), it is very important that 
the id is generated correctly! See <A href="How_ID_Generation_Works.htm">How ID 
Generation Works</A> for a discussion of how to make sure your new item will 
have the id you want. In particular, make sure to select the correct ID profile
<strong>before</strong> adding terms.</p>
<p>New&nbsp;classes and properties can be added from the 
right-click menu or the edit menu. There is no way to create a new class or 
property using drag-and-drop.&nbsp;Newly created terms are given a default name, 
and may be given a default definition and definition dbxrefs if a "personal 
definition" has been specified in the <A 
href="The_Configuration_Plugin.htm#textedit">Configuration Plugin</A>            
              
.</p>
<h2>Adding new roots</h2>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by</strong>: Edit menu, right-click</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: None</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: No sources required</p>
<p><strong>Target requirement</strong>: No target required</p>
</div>
<p>To add a new root, choose "Add root" from the edit menu or the right-click 
menu. A flyout menu will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=104 hspace=0 src="../images/add_root_menu.gif" width=275 
border=0></p>
<p>To add a new root class, choose "Add root". An id will be assigned 
automatically using the current id assignment rules.</p>
<p>To add a new property, choose "Add type root". A popup window will appear 
where you can type in the id for the new property.</p>
<h2>Adding new terms to an existing parent</h2>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by</strong>: Edit menu, right-click</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: None</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: Exactly one source relationship 
required</p>
<p><strong>Target requirement</strong>: No target required</p>
</div>
<p>New terms can be created under and existing parent. To add a new term, select the 
parent term under which the new term will be added. Then, choose "Create new 
child" from the edit menu or the right-click menu.</p>
<p>If the selected parent is a class, the id of the new class will be assigned 
automatically using the current id assignment rules. If the selected parent is a 
property, the a popup window will appear where the id of the new property can be 
entered.</p>
<p>The new class or property will have an <strong>is_a</strong> relationship to 
its parent. See <A href="Changing_Relationship_Types.htm">Changing Relationship 
Types</A> for information on how to change this relationship after it is 
created.</p>

<h2>Why is my new relationship type not showing up in OBO-Edit?</h2>
<hr>
<p>
OBO-Edit can display any relationships that are specified in an OBO
file, but by default it only shows transitive relationships. If you
are not seeing your new relationships, then it's likely that they are
not marked as transitive in your file. To see these relationship
types, you have two options:
<ul>
<li> If the relationship is transitive, make sure that it is marked
transitive. Select the relationship in the Ontology Editor Panel, and
tick the "Is transitive?" box in the Text Editor. When you save the
file, the tag "is_transitive: true" will be included in the OBO file.
<li> If the relationship is not transitive, you will have to remove
one of the default global filters. The filter that must be removed
specifies "Link type has Is Transitive". See <a
href="Global_Filters___Renderers.htm">Global Filters</a> for further
details.  
</ul>
