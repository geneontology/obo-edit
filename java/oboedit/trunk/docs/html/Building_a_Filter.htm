<h1>Building Filters</h1>

<p>This page provides an overview of how the OBO-Edit filtering system
 works, covering basic criteria common to term and link filters. For a
 more detailed description of the filter-building interface, including
 constructing complex queries, see the <a href="Term_Filters.htm">Term
 Filters</a> page. Aspects of filters specific for links are described
 on the <a href="Link_Filters.htm">Link Filters</a> page.
</p>

<p>The standard filtering control looks like this:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 
src="../images/filter_term_standard.png" border=0></p>

<p>Clicking the <img src="search/Picture%2018.png" alt=""> icon reveals an additional selector:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 
src="../images/filter_term_extended.png" border=0></p>

<p>The controls in this component have the following 
names:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0

border=0></p>

<p>The meaning of some of these components is not immediately
obvious. The detailed discussion of these components is presented out
of order, with the more commonly used features described first.</p>

<h4>Overview of How Filtering is Done</h4>
<p>For each term in the ontology, the <em>aspect</em> control determine which 
terms should be examined to establish a match. (Normally, the search aspect is 
<em>self</em>, so only the term itself is examined.) The <em>attribute</em> 
values are then fetched for each term to be examined. Sometimes there will be a 
single&nbsp;<em>attribute</em> value (if the attribute is "name", for example) 
or sometimes there will be several (if the attribute is "synonym" or "dbxref", 
for example). Each <em>attribute</em> value is compared against the 
user-provided <em>value</em> using the given <em>comparison</em>. If ANY of the 
<em>attributes</em> match the <em>value</em>, the term matches the filter. 
Finally, if the <em>don't have</em> option is selected, the result of the match is 
inverted.</p>
<h4>Attribute</h4>
<p>The search attribute describes which part of the term should be comparied 
against the contents of the <em>value</em> box. </p>
<p>Different attributes contain different types of values. Some attributes 
contain text values, some contain numeric values, and others contain boolean 
(true/false) values. The type of an attribute determines the possible 
<em>comparisons</em> that can be done on that attribute.</p>
<p>Some attributes contain a single value (like "name" or "comment" or any 
boolean attribute). Some attributes contain many values (like "id", "synonym", 
and "dbxref"). Note that if an attribute contains many values, each attribute 
value is compared against the user-provided <em>value</em>. Only one attribute 
value needs to match for the whole filter to be considered a match.</p>
<p>There are a number of built-in attributes that can be searched:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Any Text Field</strong> <em>(multiple text values) </em>- Searches the term name, 
  id, synonyms, definition and comments 
  <li><strong>Name or Synonym</strong> <em>(multiple text values)</em> - Searches the term name 
  and synonyms 
  <li><strong>ID</strong> <em>(multiple text values)</em> - Searches the term's primary 
  id and secondary ids 
  <li><strong>Subset</strong> <em>(multiple text values)</em> - Searches the 
  <em>ids</em> of the subsets to which a term belongs. For example, if a term 
  belongs to a subset called "Plant GO Slim" with the id "goslim_plant" and a 
  subset called "Generic GO Slim" with the id "goslim_generic", the 
  <em>subset</em> attribute will 
  contain "goslim_plant" and "goslim_generic". 
  <li><strong>Name</strong> <em>(single text value)</em> - Searches the term name 
  <li><strong>Synonym</strong><em> (multiple text values)</em> - Searches the term synonyms 

  <li><strong>Comment</strong> <em>(single text value)</em> - Searches the term comment 
  <li><strong>Definition</strong> <em>(single text value)</em> - Searches the term definition 
  <li><strong>Namespace</strong>&nbsp;<em>(single text value)</em> - Searches the term namespace ID. So if a term belongs to a 
  namespace called "Molecular function" with the id "molecular_function", this 
  attribute will contain "molecular_function" 
  <li><strong>Dbxref</strong> <em>(multiple text values)</em> - Searches all the term 
  dbxrefs, including general dbxrefs, synonym dbxrefs, and definition dbxrefs. 
  Dbxref searches only look at the dbxref itself, not the optional dbxref 
  description text. 
  <li><strong>General dbxref</strong> <em>(multiple text values)</em> - Searches all general 
  term dbxrefs, but not synonym dbxrefs or definition dbxrefs. 
  <li><strong>Definition dbxref</strong> <em>(multiple text values)</em> - 
  Searches all definition dbxrefs, but not synonym dbxrefs or general dbxrefs. 
  <li><strong>Synonym dbxref</strong> <em>(multiple text values)</em> - Searches all synonym 
  dbxrefs, but not definition dbxrefs or general dbxrefs. 
  <li><strong>Is intersection</strong> <em>(boolean value)</em> - Whether or not this term is an 
  intersection (aka cross product).
  <li><strong>Is is_a complete</strong> <em>(boolean 
  value)</em> - Whether or not there is an unbroken 
  chain of is_a links from this term to a root. 
  <li><strong>Has is_a parent</strong>&nbsp;<em>(boolean 
  value)</em> - Whether or not this term 
  has at least one is_a link to a parent.
  <li><strong>Has parent with type id</strong> <em>(boolean
  value)</em> - Whether or not this term has a parent of the type
  specified in the value.
  <li><strong>Is anonymous</strong> <em>(boolean value)</em> - Whether or not this term is 
  anonymous. Currently, there is no way to create an anonymous term in OBO-Edit, 
  so this will only find anonymous terms loaded from a file. 
  <li><strong>Is class</strong> <em>(boolean value)</em> - Whether this term is a class. 
  Instances and Relations will return false for this attribute. 
  <li><strong>Is obsolete</strong> <em>(boolean value)</em> - Whether this term is obsolete. 
  <li><strong>Is property</strong> <em>(boolean value)</em> - Whether this term is a property, i.e. a relation. 
  Classes and instances will return false for this attribute. 
  <li><strong>Parent count</strong> <em>(single numeric value)</em> - The number of parents a 
  term has. Note that this is a numeric value, so the possible comparisons for 
  this attribute will be different than for other attributes. 
  <li><strong>Is implied</strong> <em>(boolean value)</em> - Whether this term was created by a 
  reasoner. OBO-Edit's reasoner will never create new terms, so implied terms 
  can only be loaded from a file that was created by an external reasoner, like 
  OBOL. 
  <li><strong>Is transitive</strong> <em>(boolean value)</em> - Whether a relation is marked 
  transitive. This attribute will return false for all non-relations. 
  <li><strong>Is built in</strong><em> (boolean value)</em> - Whether a term is 
  one of the built-in OBO objects, like the <strong>is_a</strong> relation. Note 
  that there are some built-in classes that are hidden by default.</li>
  <li><strong>Keyword</strong> <em>(boolean value)</em> -  Searches all 
  the keywords for this term. Keywords include all text fields and dbxrefs.
  <li><strong>Has multiple roots</strong> <em>(boolean value)</em> - Whether a term has a path to more than one root.
</ul>
<p>Several additional attributes are specifically relevant to links, and are discussed in the <a href="Link_Filters.htm">link filter</a> documentation.
</p>
<h4>Comparison</h4>
<p>The search comparison chooses the method that will be used to determine 
whether the user-provided <em>value</em> matches the current <em>attribute</em>. 
The possible comparisons change depending on the attribute type. If a boolean 
attribute is selected, the comparison box (and the value box) are not shown at 
all, because boolean attributes return true or false values, and no further 
comparison needs to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Text Attribute Comparisons</strong></p>
<p>Text attribute comparisons are not case-sensitive.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>equals</strong> - 
  Matches if an attribute value and the user value are exactly the same. 
  <li><strong>contains</strong> - 
  Matches if an attribute contains the user value. 
  <li><strong>starts with</strong> - 
  Matches if an attribute starts with the user value. 
  <li><strong>ends with</strong> - Matches if an attribute ends with the user 
  value.</li>
  <li><strong>matches wildcard</strong> - Performs a 
  wildcard match where * is the wildcard character. For example, the wildcard 
  string "*e*ple" would match the strings "people", "example" and "temple" (and probably 
  many others) 
  <li><strong>matches regexp</strong> - Performs a regular expression
  match. See <a
  href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html">http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html</a>,
  <a
  href="http://www.newbie.org/gazette/xxaxx/xprmnt02.html">http://www.newbie.org/gazette/xxaxx/xprmnt02.html</a>,
  and <a
  href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perlre.pod">http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perlre.pod</a>
  for information on how regular expressions work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Numeric Attribute Comparisons</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>equals</strong> - 
  Matches if the attribute value and the user value are exactly the same. 
  <li><strong>&lt;</strong> - Matches 
  if the attribute value is less than the user value 
  <li><strong>&lt;=</strong> - Matches 
  if the attribute value is less than or equal to the user value 
  <li><strong>&gt;</strong> - Matches 
  if the attribute value is greater than the user value. 
  <li><strong>&gt;=</strong>&nbsp;- Matches if that attribute value is greater 
  than or equals to the user value.</li></ul>
<h4>Value</h4>
<p>The <em>value</em> will be matched against the&nbsp;<em>attribute</em> value 
using the <em>comparison</em>. If the <em>attribute</em> is a numeric attribute, 
the <em>value</em> must be an integer, otherwise nothing will match.</p>
<h4>have/don't have</h4>
<p>The default for this selector is <em>have</em>, and the <em>don't have</em> option inverts the search.
If a search would normally return all terms 
with the word "kinase" in the name, but the <em>don't have</em> option is selected, the 
search will find every term that does <strong>not</strong> have "kinase" in the name.</p>
<h4>Aspect</h4>
<p>Without a doubt, this is the most misunderstood aspect of OBO-Edit filtering, 
but it is essential for doing powerful, complex searches.</p>
<p>Normally when searching, every term in the ontology is checked to
see if it matches the current search criteria. But if a search aspect
is specified, each term is checked to see if <strong>other related
terms</strong> match the search criteria. If one of the related terms
matches, the original search term is considered a match. Note that the
aspect selector is hidden by default, and appears when the <img
src="search/Picture%2018.png" alt=""> button is clicked.</p>
<p>            
There are three possible values for the search aspect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<div><strong>Self</strong>           - 
The default behavior. Only the current term is examined.</div>
  <li>
<div><strong>Ancestor</strong>       - Instead of the current 
term itself, examine the ancestors of the current term.</div>
  <li>
<div><strong>Descendant</strong>       - Instead of the current 
term itself, examine the descendants of the current term.</div>
<div><strong>Parent</strong>       - Instead of the current 
term itself, examine the parents of the current term.</div></li></ul>
<p>To demonstrate how aspects work, let's consider a really simple 
ontology...</p>
<p><IMG  hspace=0 src="../images/toy_ontology.png" 
border=0></p>
<p>(Note that D has two parents, B &amp; C.)</p>
<p>If we search for <strong>[Self] [Name] [equals] "B"</strong> (shorthand for 
"use the aspect 'Self', the attribute 'Name', the comparison 'equals' and the 
search value 'B'"), we get a single result: <strong>B</strong>. Just as we'd 
expect.</p>
<p>But if we change the aspect to <strong>Descendant</strong>, we get a 
different result: <strong>A</strong>. This is because term <strong>A</strong> 
has a descendant whose name equals "B". No other term matches, because no other 
term has a descendant with the name "B". <strong>B</strong> itself doesn't 
match, because <strong>B</strong> is not a descendant of itself.</p>
<p>If we change the search to <strong>[Descendant] [Name] [equals] "D"</strong>, 
we get 3 results: <strong>A, B,</strong> and <strong>C.</strong> This is because 
these terms are the only terms with a descendant named "D".</p>
<p>The ancestor aspect works in a similar way. If we search for 
<strong>[Ancestor] [Name] [equals] "B"</strong>, we get&nbsp;2 results: 
<strong>D </strong>and <strong>F</strong>. These are the two terms that have an 
ancestor with the name "B". <strong>E</strong> does not match, because none of 
its ancestors (<strong>C</strong> and <strong>A</strong>) have a name that 
equals "B".</p>

<h1>When will I ever use this?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
People have been so confused by search aspects that you 
may ask why we bother to include it at all. In fact, this feature was removed 
from a few beta-test versions of OBO-Edit.
</p>
<p>It was then almost immediately reinstated, because it's the only way to do 
really interesting searches.</p>
<p>Search aspects are particularly useful for two things: filtering and compound 
searches. When filtering, search aspects can help pick out subsections of an 
ontology graph (you may, for example, decide you only want to see descendants of 
the "molecular_function" term). When doing compound searches, search aspects can 
help you narrow the search to a particular branch of the ontology.</p>
