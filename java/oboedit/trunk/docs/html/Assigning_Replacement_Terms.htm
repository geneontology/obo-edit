<h1>Assigning Replacement Terms</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most terms are obsoleted due to flaws such as falling outside the
scope of the ontology, faulty definitions, etc. Often, one or more
terms in the ontology can be substituted for the obsolete
term. OBO-Edit allows users to specify replacements for obsolete
terms. These replacements can be used by human annotators as a useful
reference, or can be used by software to automatically re-assign
database entities that were associated with a term that became
obsolete.</p>

<h2>Specifying a Replacement Term</h2>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by</strong>: drag and drop</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: none</p>
<p><strong>Target required?</strong>: yes</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: one or more source terms required</p>
</div>
<p>If an obsolete term can be exchanged for another term or terms in all instances of usage (e.g. in annotations or mappings), the new term(s) may 
be specified as a <em>replacement</em> term. Note that a replacement term should 
only be specified if the obsolete term can be replaced by <em>exactly this term 
in every case</em>. If this criterion is not met, use a "consider" term 
instead.</p>
<p>Replacement terms should be specified when possible, because replacement 
terms can be used by software agents to do automatic corrections in databases 
when a term becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>To specify a replacement for an obsolete term, select a source term to act as 
the replacement. Drag the replacement source onto the target obsolete term. When 
the term is dropped, a menu will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=39 hspace=0 src="../images/replacement_drop_menu.png" 
border=0></p>
<p>Choose "Add replacement term" from the menu to assign the replacement term.</p>
<h2>Specifying a Term to Consider</h2>
<p><strong>Gesture types:</strong> drag and drop</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: none</p>
<p><strong>Target required?:</strong> yes</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements:</strong> one or more source terms required</p>
<p>Often, there is not a single accurate replacement term for an obsolete term. 
Usually there are several possible substitutes, and the correct replacement 
depends on context. In these cases, a user may specify one or more "consider" 
terms that a human expert would look at.</p>
<p>To specify a "consider" term for an obsolete term, select&nbsp;one or 
more&nbsp;source terms to consider. Drag the&nbsp;"consider" source onto the 
target obsolete term. When the terms&nbsp;are dropped, a menu will appear:</p>
<p><IMG height=39 hspace=0 src="../images/replacement_drop_menu.png" 
border=0></p>
<p>Choose "Add consider term" from the menu to assign the replacement terms.</p>
<h2>Removing Replacement/Consider Terms</h2>
<p><strong>Gesture types</strong>: right-click menu, edit menu</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: none</p>
<p><strong>Target required?:</strong> no</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: one or more source terms required</p>
<p>To remove a replacement or consider term, select the consider or replacement 
term to remove <em>underneath the obsolete term to which it is assigned</em>. 
That is, make sure that you have selected the term to remove in the context 
where it is preceded by the label "replaced by" or "consider":</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/obsolete-replacement-view.png" 
border=0></p>
<p>From the right-click or edit menu, choose either "Remove consider term" or 
"Remove replacement term".</p>
