<h1>Cloning</h1>
<div class="tabbed">
<p><strong>Works by</strong>: Edit menu, right-click</p>
<p><strong>Hot keys</strong>: Command+L</p>
<p><strong>Source requirements</strong>: One or more source relationships required</p>
<p><strong>Target requirement</strong>: No target required</p>
</div>
<p>The Clone operation creates an exact duplicate of one or more terms, but 
assigns new id numbers to the duplicates. The duplicate terms have the same 
parents, children, namespace, definition, comments, synonyms, dbxrefs, and 
subset assignments as the original term (alternate ids are not preserved). The 
name of the cloned term is "CLONE OF &lt;the original term name&gt;".</p>
<p>To clone one or more terms, select the terms and choose "Clone" from the 
right-click or edit menu, or press the "Command" and "L" keys.</p>

<p>Note that the Clone operation will give the cloned terms exactly the same
relationships as the original source terms. If parent-child 
relationships exist between the source terms, parallel parent-child 
relationships between the cloned terms will <em>not</em> be created. 
For example, if you select a cluster of three terms where one of the terms is a 
parent of the other two:</p>

<p>       After cloning, three cloned terms are created. Each of these has the
same relationships as the original source terms. However, parallel
parent-child relationships between the cloned terms are not created:</p>
