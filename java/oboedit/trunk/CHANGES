Changes in b49:

- Fixed bug 2026858: Gray terms in OTE after removing parent in Parent Editor.  
Fix is in PathUtil.pathIsCircular:  it doesn't count as a circular path if the
relationship leading to the already-visited child is symmetric (disjoint_from
or inverse of).
- Greatly improved speed of using Parent Editor to add/delete parent
relationships (SF 1963283: Parent Editor is very slow).  It no longer tries to
find and select ALL instances of current term in OTE.

- Fixed bug [ 1989257 ] "Remove redundant links" doesn't work

- Closed bug [ 2010574 ] Trim redundant links when integrating XPs.
Can be achieved using global link filters.  The same filter can be
used in combination with "save implied links [for presentation]" to remove
redundant links when implied links are instantiated for release.



Features:
- [ 2086577 ] add parent to filter menu
Added "Parent" to pulldown list in advanced options in search panel (click the
gear icon) - enables searching for terms with a given parent.

To Do:
- Documentation for Parent search panel option with examples
- Documentation for setting up global link filter to remove redundant links display from OTE
