	* Fixed bug where synonym dbxrefs would be lost on synonym edit (SF 1843460)
	* Added editor for synonym dbxrefs
	* Dbxref listing is now always the same size in synonym editor (SF 1843405)
	* Live error highlighting in the text editor now works properly
	* All TableList editors (like the dbxref editors and the synonym editor) now commit
	  their changes the minute they are unfocused, which should make them easier to
	  use
	* On Macs, top-level application menu now says "OBO-Edit2" [we can
	  change that string if people don't like it] rather than using the
	  Java class name (org.oboedit.launcher.OBOEdit).
          Should have no effect on non-Macs.
