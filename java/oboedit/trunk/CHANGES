Changes in b44:
- If user selects (in another component) too many things at once, Graph Editor
will ignore the selection event rather than try to show all of the new
selected terms (too slow).  Also, if there are too many (>500) objects, the
"Show->Everything" menu item in the GE is disabled.
- I made disjoint_from relations show up as leaves in the OTE and Graph
Editor, so you can't traverse them down an infinite path ("cat is
disjoint_from dog is disjoint_from cat is..").
- Fixed bug 2026858, "OTE loses little arrows when there's a pseudo-cycle".
Now instead of losing their arrows and relation labels, the "circular"
relations are shown in gray text rather than black.  (You won't see this with
disjoint_from, since it now makes those leaves and you can't traverse them
down to the repetitive point anyway.)
- Spaced out text icons (e.g. disjoint_from) in OTE a bit for easier
readability.
