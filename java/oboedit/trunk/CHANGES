	* In Configuration Manager, button for changing link color now looks
          like a button and the color name is shown in the appropriate color
          (rather than just in black).
	* New "-help" command-line option prints usage message and exits.
	* Fixed problem where Graph Editor wasn't showing changes in icons
	  or link colors until you did something that made it refresh
	  itself (e.g., expand a node).  Now it refreshes when you save your
	  configuration change so you see the new icon and/or color right
	  away.
	* Temporarily put new "regulates" icon contenders into icons
          directory (src/org/oboedit/gui/resources/icons/typeicons) so that
          users can look at them.  NOT YET COMMITTED--once there is agreement
          on the favorites, I will commit those.
	* Autosave is now turned on by default; users can turn it off via the
          Configuration Manager if they wish.
	* Added (to BBOP) CheckMemoryThread that runs in the background and
          warns user if the available memory is >95% used up.
