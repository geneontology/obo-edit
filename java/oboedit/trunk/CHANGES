Changes in 2.000-b40:
- Fixed bug 1887110:
The option to add relationships, move, etc. by right-clicking the target
just doesn't work. I select one term, and when I select a second term to be
the target, I get the same menu as when I right-click a single term -- no
options to add parent, add child, move or merge. It also looks as though
the first (source) term is spontaneously deselected.
The problem was that if you use command-click (on a one-button mouse) to
simulate right-click, java.swing.SwingUtilities.isLeftMouseButton returns true
(and so does java.swing.SwingUtilities.isRightMouseButton), which resulted in
the wrong behavior.
