Changes in 2.000-b34:
* Installers will now keep separate install histories for OE1, OE2, and
Phenote, to avoid misleadingly prompting you to install any of them on top of
each other.  (In fact, it will now explicitly warn you if you try to do that.)
(Note: this application is now referred to as "OBO-Edit2" to reduce confusion
with OBO-Edit 1.)
* For those who prefer to launch OE from the command line, "oe-command-line"
script is now included.  (I gave it that somewhat awkward name because I
didn't want users to confuse it with the "real" OBO-Edit application.)
Note that you can also double-click on oe-command-line and it will launch just
like OBO-Edit, but with a Terminal that shows all the stderr/stdout, which
seems even better, at least for the power users who can then report error
messages more easily.
* There are now two different reasoners that you can choose from with a new
pulldown list in the Reasoner Manager.  The two that are currently registered
are ForwardChainingReasoner (old; faster but less complete) and
LinkPileReasoner (Chris recently switched OE to using this one--better but
slower).
* Reasoner Manager now comes up docked by default.
* SemanticParser Manager no longer shows Reasoner checkbox.
* "Regulates" links are now orange (were dark red, but that didn't work well
with the red negatively_regulates icon).
* Removed default global filter "Select links where Type that have a 'Is
Transitive'" in order to let regulates relationships show up.  (This global
filter can be re-added by the user if desired.)
* Width of search results columns can now be adjusted.
