1. The spell checker doesn't run unless you change the repeated word check
config, even though it's supposedly on.
(Now the definition spell-checker runs (by default) when you do a manual check.)
2. There are so many words missing from the dictionary it causes a crash
when you run a spell check on the definitions.
To prevent this, I am limiting the number of warnings shown to about 200.  (I
say "about" because it depends how many warnings the last checked term
has--you can end up with 204 warnings or so, but not much more than that.)
This cutoff should ideally be user-configurable.

- Installer now won't let you set the memory allocation higher than 2048M.
This works on my Mac, but unfortunately was not enough to fix bug 2111929,
which affects some Windows machines.  Sandra's Windows box can't start OE if
the memory setting is >1568M, but I don't want to make that the cap for
everyone.


Features:
- Advanced Tab in Configuration Manager
- Relations section in OTE only shows user-specified relations (no built-ins).
- Cross Products Tab in Text Editor now shows only user-defined relations while selecting Discriminating relations.
