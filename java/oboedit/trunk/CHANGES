Changes in b44:
- If user selects (in another component) too many things at once, Graph Editor
will ignore the selection event rather than try to show all of the new
selected terms (too slow).
- Fixed bug 2026858, "OTE loses little arrows when there's a pseudo-cycle".
Now instead of losing their arrows and relation labels, the "circular"
relations are shown in gray text rather than black.
- Spaced out text icons (e.g. disjoint_from) in OTE a bit for easier
readability.
