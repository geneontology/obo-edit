Changes in b45:
- Searching is now MUCH faster!
- Built-ins (e.g. "xsd:date") are not included in search.
- If you select >200 search results, the OTE doesn't try to select and
show all of them (it just shows the first one).
- Pre-loads relationship icons (when ontology is loaded) for quicker
response the first time you show something in the OTE.  (The slowness
was partly due to having to load the relationship icons.)
- Fixed SF 1944177.  Now when you add a new dbxref, tab moves
circularly between fields, and return commits the current dbxref (and
does not create a new empty dbxref).  [Still need to fix this in
Synonym editor.]
