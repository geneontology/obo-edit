	* Minor bug fixes (e.g., table of contents panel now lists A-Z rather
	  	than A-Y (SF 1849467))
	* New help pages added; some existing help pages updated (much remains
	  	to be done)
	* A default history is now included with the release.  When user does
	  	"Load ontologies", it opens showing a default ontology filename
		 (right now, test_resources/camphor_catabolism.obo--we
	  	probably should change this).
		I would like it to automatically load this ontology if the
	  	user has no history!
