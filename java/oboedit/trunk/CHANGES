Changes in b49:

- Fixed bug 2026858: Gray terms in OTE after removing parent in Parent Editor.  
Fix is in PathUtil.pathIsCircular:  it doesn't count as a circular path if the
relationship leading to the already-visited child is symmetric (disjoint_from
or inverse of).
- Greatly improved speed of using Parent Editor to add/delete parent
relationships (SF 1963283: Parent Editor is very slow).  It no longer tries to
find and select ALL instances of current term in OTE.

Features:
- [ 2086577 ] add parent to filter menu
Added "Parent" to pulldown list in advanced options in search panel (click the
gear icon) - enables searching for terms with a given parent.
