Changes in 2.000-b39:
- Fixed cloning (broke in b38).
- If user changes font size in Configuration Manager, change it in Ontology
Tree Editor right away.
- Fixed OWL reader (it was expecting a URI--enabled it to accept either a URI
or a filename (which it will convert to a URI)).
- Directory where preferences is saved (which used to be ~/.oboeditbeta, which
was hidden in many file browsers) is now an OS-appropriate visible location
(e.g., on Mac, it's /Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/OBO-Edit2-beta/).
If user had prefs files in ~/.oboeditbeta, and the new OS-appropriate config
directory doesn't exist yet, OE offers to copy the files from ~/.oboeditbeta
to the new directory.
- New date stamp syntax was choking OE1.  Reverted the date stamp in the
header to use the old format, so it won't choke OE1.  OE1 should ignore the
creation_date fields, so those are still using the new date format (which
*will* choke older OE2 betas, but you shouldn't be using those anyway).
- Graph Editor will no longer run in the background if you don't have it in
your current layout.  This is a win because the Graph Editor consumes a lot of
memory and CPU, and it was annoying to have it doing so even if it wasn't
actually visible.  The small downside of this fix is that if you switch
between different layouts (Verify and Edit) during a session, the Graph Editor
will forget what it was showing.
- Eliminated some of the the unwanted degenerate popup menus (the ones with
just two items) that you sometimes got if you left-clicked several terms in
quick succession by not offering "Add consider term" or "Add replacement term"
menu items if you drag from a term to itself.
However, you may still get the drag popup menu (with six items) when you
clicked on two terms but didn't think you were dragging.  Swing is kind of
sensitive to sloppy clicking and tends to consider it a drag if you haven't
fully released the mouse button before moving to the next term.  I haven't
come up with a good way to differentiate between these unintentional "drags"
and intentional drags.
- Fixed bug #1882559: Global filters present at loading time can't be removed.
(This means, for example, that now if you have an old oboedit configuration
that has the "is transitive" filter set, you can turn this filter off and see
the effect immediately (regulates links show up) rather than having to quit
and restart OE.)
Note: this is fixed in the Ontology Term Editor, but not in the Graph Editor.
- Fixed bug #1944911: Values in filter not filled in when you load a saved
filter, which turned out to be the same bug as 1934745 ("Value" in filter in
OTE config panel goes away).
- Term renderer color change buttons are now visible (were invisible, at least
on Mac).
- Amina made OBO-Edit use log4j logging.  Messages are printed on the console
unadorned, and saved in a logfile with more details (time, calling method).
Logfile name can be see in the Configuration Manager.
- Added button to Configuration Manager to allow user to remove their config
files and let them reset to the defaults.
- New menus!  View menu is now separated into top-level menus:
