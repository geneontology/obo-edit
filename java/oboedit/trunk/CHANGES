Changes in b47 (15 Aug 2008):
- Don't automatically start a new dbxref record when user commits the previous
one--let them do that if they want to.
- Fixed dbxref library bug (SF 2025804):  adding 3 or more dbxrefs to a term
caused havoc.  (For some reason, you only saw this bug if you changed your
default font size!)
- Fixed: If you start up OE with the reasoner on (from the previous session),
it doesn't show that in the titlebar until you load an ontology (SF 2048191).
- Jen has improved the Graphviz component.  Config settings are now
accessed via the wrench icon instead of the archaic options button.
- When dragging term(s) in the OTE, the drag target must be obsolete
to show the menu items "Add/Consider replacement".
- Fixed problem that wasted a huge amount of CPU rendering synonyms
that have errors.  I suspect that this was a major cause of the CPU
spikes that midori was seeing, because she said she was adding/editing
synonyms.
- "Cyclical" relationships shown in OTE with double-headed arrow
icons.
- Enabled mass addition of dbxrefs (regular or definition) to all selected
terms (feature request 2032637) from Dbxref Library component.
