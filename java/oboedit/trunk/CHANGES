Changes in b48:
- Fixed "bouncing" synonym display when editing neighboring synonyms (SF bug
2057430).
- When run from the command line on Mac, OE now shows up in the dock with the
OBO-Edit icon rather than the boring gray "exec" icon.
- Layout menu now has "Import perspective" to add a new perspective (from an
.idw file).  (The instructions on the Perspectives help page for adding a new
perspective were incomplete.)
