Notes
============
Effective bug reports are the most likely to be fixed. These guidelines 
explain how to write such reports.
    * Reproduce your bug using the most recent release, to see weather it has already been fixed.
    * Be precise and clear - explain the behavior so others can reproduce the bug
    * Limit bugs to one per report
    * No bug is too trivial to report - small bugs may hide big bugs
    * Clearly separate fact from speculation
    * Search the Bugs Tracker to check weather your bug has already been reported

* Reporting a New Bug *
- If you have reproduced a bug in the most recent release and no-one else 
appears to have reported it, then report it on our sourceforge bug tracker:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418257&group_id=36855&func=browse

Frequently Asked Questions
============================
1. Why is there a beta release for OBO-Edit after the 2.0 official release?
This version includes bug fixes and some new features while additional significant features are in the pipeline. 
The 2.1 official release is pending completion of those features and fixing of bugs posted for 2.0.

2. Why has the location of the configuration folder changed?
In the previous versions the location of the config folder was a characteristic of the opterating system used. 
This led to a lot of confusion and most users could not locate their config folder hence I decided to change it 
to a standard location in the file system.

2nd October - J. Deegan committed new Tag Filter code. This feature enables 
users to choose which tags are saved out into OBO files. The GUI is in the 
'save as' dialog. There is still some work to do to make the GUI look less intimidating. Also, though the feature has been
carefully tested, further testing will be required in case an obscure bug is causing parts of
the data not to be saved out at all. I have not yet run the JUnit tests. When this code is released we should warn in-house users to
watch diffs carefully for lost tags.
