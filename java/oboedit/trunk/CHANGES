===  OBO-Edit v2.1 RELEASE NOTES  ===

==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1.1-b8
==============================
[ geneontology-Feature Requests-3181194 ] allow obsolete term to have same name as live term
The issue here is that there were two terms with the same name but different
IDs. Ramona wanted to be able to drag the live term onto the obsolete term and
see the menu items for adding a consider or replaced_by relation between the
two same-named terms, and it wasn't showing those menu items.

==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1.1-b7 (2/28/2012)
==============================
Quick Save fixes:
[ geneontology-Bugs-3487349 ] Quick save lets you save the first time when it shouldn't
If you loaded via Advanced interface, you could then do a Quick Save the first
time you saved (but it didn't actually know yet what file to save to, so it
tried to save to null).
[ geneontology-Bugs-3490963 ] quick save not working properly
Was letting you do Quick Save before you'd done Save As on that file.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3486945 ] 64bit JRE can not be used on windows 7
Windows apparently doesn't let you designate a preferred Java version, so the
installer can do no better than using the first Java it comes across. The fix
is to distribute two Windows installers: 32-bit and 64-bit, and let Windows
users choose the appropriate one.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3487892 ] In compound ancestor/descendant queries, relation list bad
In a compound search with two aspects, the relation pulldown lists didn't
behave well. This turned out to be because of basically infinite refreshing of
the lists.


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1.1-b6 (2/6/2012)
==============================
- When user saves their work in a file, the titlebar changes to show the new
filename--but don't do that if the save was an autosave.
- [ geneontology-Bugs-3481225 ] Can't launch two (recent) OBO-Edits at the
same time
(Fixed by upgrading InstallAnywhere)


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1.1-b5
==============================
TEMPORARY WORKAROUND for [ geneontology-Bugs-3481225 ] Can't launch two (recent) OBO-Edits at the same time
[Fixed properly in 2.1.1-b6]

Minor change:
Warn about possible stale config files when launching new version--but
not when a user who's never installed OBO-Edit launches for the first
time. (Existing users won't notice this change.)


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1.1-b4
==============================
OWL Adapter:
- Fixed issue where file browser strips off .owl extension if you select an
existing .owl file. (Can't fix problem in file browser itself, which is
native, but the OWL adapter now restores the .owl suffix after you select the file.)
- Added user guide page about OWL adapter

New feature:
[ geneontology-Feature Requests-3476913 ] Warn about possible stale config files when launching new version
Whenever you upgrade to a new version of OBO-Edit, there is the risk that
out-of-date binary files in your ~/oboedit_config (mostly in
oboedit_config/perspectives) will cause bad behavior of various unexpected
sorts (for example, sometimes it makes Autocommit in the Text Editor not
work). Now a warning message about it pops up the first time you run a new
OBO-Edit release (and it offers to rename oboedit_config/perspectives for you.)


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1.1-b3
==============================
- I made the configuration option "Confirm on exit" say "Confirm on exit, even
if there are no changes to be saved", and I made it default to false instead of true.

Fixed some issues with new Quick Save:
- If you do quick save when you have unsaved changes in the text editor, it doesn't warn you (Save As does)
- If you save as obo and then save as owl, quick save says you can't quick save yet, and also when it does
the save as, it does it again after you hit ok.
- [ geneontology-Bugs-3475532 ] 'Write ontology' box not dismissed upon save

Fixed the evil twin Cross Product Editor problems:
[ geneontology-Bugs-3471901] can't delete cross products
[ geneontology-Bugs-3303595] deleting genus relationship in cross product tab
In an earlier version of OE, the genus would mysteriously disappear
when you committed. Chris and Amina fixed this by caching the value of
the genus field in AutocompleteBox and restoring it when it
disappeared. However, this had the unwanted side effect of making it
impossible to delete the genus by erasing the genus field--it would
simply reappear, like a zombie returned from the dead, when you committed.
Now you should be able to save OR delete your genus.


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1.1-b1 and b2
==============================
New features:
- [ geneontology-Feature Requests-3469108 ] Titlebar should show last saved-as filename
- [ geneontology-Feature Requests-1604638 ] quick save
After your first Save As, you can do a quick Save (command-S) to save the ontology again with the same save parameters.
(A message window briefly appears letting you know the quick save worked.)
- [ geneontology-Feature Requests-3375766 ] Automatic detection of changed files/reload option
A new background thread checks whether the file you're looking at has changed on disk since you last loaded or saved it.
If it changes, a popup advises you to save your work (if you've made changes) and reload.
- Chris and Heiko got OBO<->OWL conversion working inside OBO-Edit, so you can load and/or save in OWL format.

Changes:
- When you save your configuration in the Configuration Manager, you now get a
popup message reminding you that you may need to quit and restart OE for your
changes to take effect.  (If people find this annouying, I can take it out.)


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1.0 (12/21/2011)
==============================
[geneontology-Bugs=3302934] java.lang.Object@... appearing in cross-product intersection


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-rc4 (12/9/2011)
 ==============================
[ geneontology-Feature Requests-3446935 ] IDs in the Intersection Genus box
Genus box and dropdown autocomplete list in cross product editor now show the
term name and also the ID, helping to clarify what you're actually
selecting. It also indicates if the selected genus is actually a synonym
rather than a primary term name. 
You can also now paste an ID into the genus box for completion (in the past,
you could only use term names).

Removed runtime/gopubmed-ontology-generation-service-clients-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Updated some user guide pages:
- Changed documentation on how to hide disjoint_from links in the Graph Editor
(do it using the Graph Editor filtering, NOT with a global link filter).
- Updated page on creating cross products in the Text Editor.
- Added Ramona's text about how to specify the domain and range of a relation.


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-rc3 (11/14/2011)
==============================
- Fixed a null pointer exception that sometimes was thrown during merges, and
which may or may not have anything to do with the sporadic loss of information
(synonyms, etc.) from merges that some users have observed.
- At Chris M's request, these adapters or components have been removed:
	The OBO OWL Adapter
	The OWL URL Reader
	The GO Association File Adapter
        Semantic Parser Manager
- Discovered that the serial writer and reader were both broken, and not easy
to fix, and no one uses them anyway, so they are gone for now.
- Updated some user guide pages.
- Thomas Waechter checked in some changes to the Ontology Generation component.


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-rc2 (10/14/2011)
==============================
Fixed:
[ geneontology-Bugs-3422171 ] definition dbxref button not working
[ geneontology-Bugs-3422288 ] Dictionary errors when adding to alwayslowercase
(Note that this was not a new bug; this had been in OE for a long time and probably
hadn't been noticed because the quick fixes weren't working.)


==============================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-rc1 (10/11/2011)
==============================
Fixed:
[ geneontology-Bugs-3418128 ] namespace manager not saving new namespace
[ geneontology-Bugs-3419113 ] Name Redundancy check very slow in 2.1-b19
Prevented exceptions that were keeping some quick-fixes from working.


================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta19 (9/29/2011)
================================

[ geneontology-Bugs-3388601 ] obo2obo no longer prints status messages to stdout
(obo2obo and the other command-line utilities now do their own logger
configuring so you once again see status messages on stdout.)

Turned off repeated whitespace check by default
(see bug [ geneontology-Bugs-2784022 ] verification checks--repeated words,
sentence boundaries)

[ geneontology-Feature Requests-3408075 ] Allow 64 bit to be chosen on install
Heiko improved the installer so that if you have a 64-bit computer with 64-bit
Java, the installer will install OBO-Edit so that it will launch in 64-bit
mode.  The installer tries to detect if you have a 64-bit machine, in which
case it suggests a larger memory allocation, but it is (by necessity)
conservative about this (because if it suggested a too-high memory setting you
wouldn't be able to launch OE at all), so it may limit you to an 1860M
setting. If this happens, you can hand-edit OBO-Edit.vmoptions and put a
higher memory setting (up to the amount of physical memory on your computer),
and then relaunch OE (twice, if you're on a Mac).

[ geneontology-Bugs-2507049 ] b52 - history browser won't save history

Made cutoff for number of warnings to show in Verification Manager 500 instead
of 300.

[ geneontology-Feature Requests-1925380 ] Verification plugin should flag synonyms that match term

[ geneontology-Feature Requests-3412485 ] "Add dbxref" button in Dbxref Library doesn't work
This broke in 2.1-b7. Now fixed.

[ geneontology-Feature Requests-2800022] Verfication check for empty DBxrefs (ID:0)

[ geneontology-Bugs-2504879 ] Verification manager 'quick-fixes' don't show up in Text Ed
If you clicked on the "quick-fix" icons in the Verification Manager, the fixes
didn't show up in the Text Editor automatically. Now they do.

[ geneontology-Feature Requests-2737303 ] Improvements to DBxref library tool
As requested, DBxref library entries are now sorted by description (if any)
and then by db:ID.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3398179 ] Extended characters result in fatal error
Fixed "Allow extended characters (except in dbxrefs)" configuration option.


================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta18 (8/18/2011)
================================

[ geneontology-Bugs-3393974 ] Beta 17 wiped out my multiple load profile
Fixed bug in new file browser

DefinitionCheck (object "has definition references but no definition")
DefinitionCheck (object "has a definition with no references")
These are now warnings rather than fatal errors.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3394041 ] Quick fix for repeated words etc. adds to wrong file
(Was adding to files in oboedit_config instead of oboedit_config/dict)

================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta17 (8/17/2011)
================================

[ geneontology-Bugs-3366931 ] beta 16 removing Xref and DBXref information
When saving, include the description for xrefs but not for definition and synonym dbxrefs
(this behavior was agreed to by the GO committee).
Might eventually want this behavior to be user-configurable.

Heiko fixed the OE installer so that if you have a 64-bit machine, you can
allocate more memory to OE and the launcher will use the correct
JavaApplicationStub.  (This will mitigate the memory issues caused by the
Reasoner.)

Heiko also made the installer suggest a lower memory allocation for Windows
users, which should take care of the issue where Windows users were unable to
launch OBO-Edit if they allocated the amount of memory suggested by the
installer.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3341954 ] File browser in Mac OBO-Edit doesn't show second hard drive
Heiko fixed this by replacing the current file browser (JFileDialog) with a
native one (FileDialog) that shows you (on a Mac) all the same things as in
your Finder. The one downside is that you can't select multiple files at the
same time in the Basic Load interface (you still can in the Advanced Load
interface), but it sounds like most users weren't doing that anyway.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3384594 ] Verification check, Name Redundancy check doesn't work
The name redundancy check is now set by default to run "During text edit",
since "On text commit" doesn't seem to work. Users can turn off that check if
they don't like it.
However, there seems to be a general problem with checks that are supposed to
run "On text commit" not running (or at least not reporting their results in a
visible way, such as when you hover over the Text Editor titlebar).


=================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta14-16 (7/8/2011)
=================================

Bug fixes:
[ geneontology-Bugs-3303596 ] Made definitions of obsolete terms editable

[ geneontology-Bugs-2309391 ] OE2 handling of unrecognized relation (text editor et al.)
Unrecognized relation was shown wrong or misleadingly in many components,
including Ontology Tree Editor (the unrecognized relation didn't show up under
'Relations', and the child didn't appear under the parent to which it is
linked with the unrecognized relation), Parent Editor (unrecognized relation
shown as "is_a"), and more.

[ geneontology-Bugs-2679772 ] Don't save dbxref lib description to obo file

[ geneontology-Bugs-3314676 ] Ancestor/descendant relationships missing
In the search panel, when looking for descendants/ancestors of a term, the
pulldown menu for relationships only includes default obo-edit relationships
and not ontology-specific relationships.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3346958 ] Type menu needs to refresh for non-binary link search

[ geneontology-Bugs-2872910 ] child search ignores relationship type

[ geneontology-Bugs-3316815 ] filtered save doesn't save dangling parents
Dangling parent save was broken (not by me) in r2703 on 5/14/2010.
The change that broke it was these two lines that were added to
OBOFileAdapter.doOperation (to fix a problem with obo2obo not setting
allowdangling to true when it should):
            for(FilteredPath filteredPath : filteredPaths)
                   filteredPath.setAllowDangling(ioprofile.allowDangling);
Commenting out those lines fixed dangling save in OBO-Edit but broke it in
obo2obo.  My compromise fix is to propagate ioprofile's allowDangling setting
to the filteredPaths only if ioprofile.allowDangling is true.  This seems to
work for both obo2obo and OBO-Edit for the cases I tried, but more testing
would be good.
(By the way, in debugging this, I discovered that the ioprofile that is passed
to doOperation doesn't always seem to be the right ioprofile, and I'm
surprised that this doesn't result in other incorrect parameter settings for
load/save.)


Changes/Improvements:
Made titlebar of Text Editor say "(OBSOLETE TERM)" in red if it's showing a
term that's obsolete.

Ontology Term Generation plugin fixed by its authors


================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta13 (5/16/2011)
================================

Bug fixes:
[ geneontology-Bugs-3296528 ] Search aspect is missing the "can be reached via" selector
[ geneontology-Bugs-3297446 ] Can't restrict ancestor search by relation type in 2.1b12
(Two reports of same bug)

[ geneontology-Bugs-3265376] Search for children is missing some (unless reasoner on)

[ geneontology-Bugs-3265349 ] Filtered save with "child" aspect throws exception

Changes/improvements:
As suggested by OEWG, all search aspects are once again available in search
aspect menu.  If user selects an aspect (Ancestor or Descendant) that requires
reasoning and the reasoner isn't on, they get a pop-up error message.
(The previous solution--leaving Ancestor and Descendant out of the aspect menu
when reasoner was off--confused users.)
(Chris M. said it should be possible to make OE invoke a simple reasoner, such
as the OnTheFly reasoner, to answer these searches correctly, but this is a
feature request for the future.)
- Also, you can (once again) do filtered saves with Ancestor and Descendant
even when the reasoner is off, because the filtered save method can start a
reasoner.
- Some users complained that these filtered saves that silently invoked the
reasoner took so long they thought OE had crashed. Now the Progress window
says "This filtered save requires the reasoner--please be patient."  (Note
that the progress string is limited in length--if you make it longer than that
it gets cut off.)

[ geneontology-Feature Requests-3302649 ] Add verification check for single intersection_of tag

Made messages about maximum memory allocation clearer (they now mention 64-bit JVMs).


================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta12 (4/25/2011)
================================

Bug fixes:
[ geneontology-Bugs-3256917 ] parent/child search problem in 2.1-b11
In 2.1-b11, when I try either 'Parent' or 'Child', the search box stops
working. The Self/Root/Parent/Child selector blanks out, and hitting the
'Search' button does nothing. I can no longer do anything with that search
panel (but if I close it and open a new one, the new panel behaves OK for
'Self' searches).

[ geneontology-Bugs-3265595 ] Configuration manager not opening?
Configuration Manager wouldn't open on some Linuxes.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3288972 ] The string "et al.," causes warning about whitespace
(I also exempted "www." from this complaint.)

[ geneontology-Bugs-3288972 ] Infinite loop while loading fly_anatomy_XP -> can't save
The problem in fly_anatomy_XP.obo turned out to be that a term (FBbt:00001913)
has an alt_id that is the same as its id.  When the obo parser is reading or
getting ready to save the ontology, the verification check looks at
FBbt:00001913 and then recursively looks at its alt_id to make sure it's ok,
and thus it ends up in an infinite loop.
I have fixed this with a two-pronged approach:
1. At the recommendation of the OBO-Edit Working Group, the OBO parser now throws
a fatal exception if the alt_id (or replaced_by) is the same as the primary ID.
2. The place in the verifier where it was going into an infinite loop now
checks for that redundancy before recursing.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3289552 ] adding words to dictionary removes uncommitted text edits
Unfortunately, fixing this involved undoing a change I had made that fixed another, more minor bug:
   [ geneontology-Bugs-3203198 ] Words added to dictionary in unedited term don't turn black immediately.
For now, we'll just have to live with the newly-added-to-dictionary word staying red until user does
something that causes a commit (or moves to another term and then back).

[geneontology-Bugs-3213778] ID Profile Mismatch dialogue box and multiple ontologies
"When opening multiple ontologies at once, I receive a dialogue box titled "ID
Profile Mismatch." The box reads: "The ID generation profile in this file does
not match the current id [sic] generation profile. Use the profile loaded from
the file?" This is confusing, as it is unclear which file is being referred to."
This message now lists the two ID profiles, so at least it's somewhat
clearer.  However, it still seems a bit random which one it chooses as the new
one if you have multiple ontologies loaded, and I have not yet added the new
feature to let you select which of multiple ID profiles you want to use.  (If
there are only two, it does let you choose between the two.)


=================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta11 (3/24/2011)
=================================

Bug fixes
-------
[ geneontology-Bugs-1899612] Some filters give wrong answers unless reasoner turned on
[ geneontology-Bugs-3169726] Search term Filter returning wrong results
- Since the Ancestor and Descendent aspects don't work unless the reasoner is
on, these aspects are now included in the aspect menu only if the reasoner is on.
- Added tooltip to "in" label before aspect that says "Note: Ancestor and
Descendent are available only if the reasoner is on.";
- Added notes to user guide about ancestor/descendent only being available if
reasoner is on.

[ geneontology-Bugs-1894720 ] multiple empty hits when searching help

[ geneontology-Bugs-2899138 ] explanation component not always working
The Explanations component and Graph Editor weren't showing explanations for
some newer explanation types (just the question, "Why is this link in the
ontology?").  Now they show raw explanations for any explanation types that
don't have a pretty form defined.

Minor changes/improvements/additions to documentation
-----------------------------------------------------
Made Configuration manager window a bit bigger so nothing is cut off.

Not all the "Show warnings" checkboxes were visible with the Verification
Manager its normal size--one was hidden.  Made labels shorter so they all fit.

Repeated word warnings: was warning about some repeated digits (e.g.,
"7.7-dimethyl-whatever").  Now all of the digits are in the allowed-repeats list.

Changed max number of warnings to show from 200(ish) to 300(ish).

Added info to user guide on how to save an ontology that has fatal errors.


=================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta10 (2/23/11)
=================================

Fixed round-tripping of two header fields in OBO output:
- data-version header field was not getting round-tripped--now it is.
- [ geneontology-Bugs-3188520] saved-by should appear in saved OBO file


=================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta9 (2/18/11)
=================================
Bug Fixes:
 [ geneontology-Bugs-3165309 ] hitting return just selects first term from dropdown list
 [ geneontology-Bugs-1897960 ] irritating selection bug in autocompletion-searches (b30)

Made release Java-1.5-compatible for users who have older Macs

Updates to user guide:
- Added user guide page on "Color-coding Multiple Ontologies in the Graph Editor".
- Merged redundant "Reasoner Manager" page into "The Reasoner and the Interface"
- Added warning about the reasoner and memory; removed descriptions of obsolete reasoners

 [ geneontology-Bugs-3170843] built in icons missing
Added generic icons (single letters, numbers, Greek letters, etc.) to the set
of built-in icons. (The icons were originally generated by the script
src/org/oboedit/gui/resources/icons/svg_script.pl).
Made window for showing built-in icons bigger (was a single long strip).

[ geneontology-Bugs-3176638 ] search result highlight color too dark
The selected search result was highlighted in a too-dark blue that made it
almost impossible to read the text.  Now it uses the same medium-light blue
highlight color as the Ontology Tree Editor.
Also fixed selection color in dropdown autocomplete list--was the same
too-dark blue as search results; now it's the same medium-light blue as the OTE.

 [ geneontology-Bugs-3182594]  java.lang.object@... appears in autocomplete results

 [ geneontology-Bugs-2890891] Obsolete terms appear in autocomplete dropdown lists
Added user-configurable ability to filter obsolete terms from search results
(and autocomplete dropdown lists).  Can be set via a checkbox in Configuration
Manager -> Behavior (but changing it requires restart).

[ geneontology-Bugs-2864861]	replaced_by statement causing problems in SO
Added more informative error message suggesting that you try using the
Advanced data adapter with the "Allow dangling references" box checked.
(I think "allow dangling references" used to be the default setting, and now
it's not.)


=================================
What's New in OBO-Edit v2.1-beta8 (1/20/11)
=================================
Bug Fixes:
[ geneontology-Bugs-3156488 ] Synonym editor wouldn't close when you committed.
That made it look like Commit wasn't working, because, for example, if you were editing a synonym and you clicked Commit,
the Synonym Editor stayed open instead of closing and looking like a finished Synonym.
Fixing this problem also turned out to fix Harold's problem where an out-of-date perspective made his Text Editor
complain that there were unsaved changes when there weren't.

[ geneontology-Bugs-2791589 ] user.dict not being detected
[ geneontology-Bugs-2053732 ] can't add words to dictionary
[ geneontology-Bugs-2504817 ] b52 - Can't save to user-defined dictionary
All of these bug reports related to the same problem: you could add words to
user.dict, but they were still flagged as mispelled.  This actually never
worked (though it was reported "fixed" more than once), due to flawed logic in
the implementation of the dictionary searches. It should now work correctly.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3024334 ] isa complete check
Fixed by Chris--exclude disjoint relationships when checking is_a complete.

[ geneontology-Bugs-3164119 ] Backup dictionary (option in Config Manager) doesn't work

Fixed docindex creation

================================

Settings from previous releases (OBO-Edit 1, 2.0 or 2.0 beta versions) are located in the 
configuration folder found at the default application installation location of your operating system. 
You can import the perspective and layout settings from previous versions to the folder called "oboedit_config"
[but note that this sometimes causes problems].
* Please note the config folder naming convention is not consistent with previous version.* 
Config files can also be reset when required through the Configuration Manager.

- Fixed bug that stopped the box at the bottom of the history browser from appearing unless another component was clicked on. 
- flaky xp commit
- graph viewer issue
- filtering union_of cycles in OTE
- lock view selection behavior
- fixed root detection algorithm to detect inverse relations and display root
(Part of OE2.0 - history browser minor bugs - ID: 2507044)
- Fixed the history browser html message so it shows 'name (id)' rather then 'id (id)'.

- Graphviz uses a lot of memory when you assign dbxrefs: ID: 2057452
The Graphviz interface redraws have been removed for the bulk addition of dbxrefs. 
Now there is only one redraw at the end of the bulk process.
- Added new feature to OBOMerge so that it reports if any term has been edited in both the live and branch files. 
- Added new feature to TermMergeHistoryItem, so it can update substitution tags that mention any term that
is in the process of being subsumed in a merge. Fixes bug: ID: 2790775


============
Features
============

- Parent Editor and Cross Product Text Editor component are now in synch and warn regarding changes made in either component

- Graph Viewer Improvements
-- Renamed "Succinct" configuration option to "Trim reasoner-generated (implied) links from display".
--> Removed reasoner dependency from displaying all-types panels and showing ancestors upto root

- New Default Global Term Renderer for highlighting terms with cross product definitions

- Cross Product Editor -> Go to Genus term button

- J. Deegan committed new Tag Filter code. This feature enables 
users to choose which tags are saved out into OBO files. The GUI is in the 
'save as' dialog. There is still some work to do to make the GUI look less intimidating. Also, though the feature has been
carefully tested, further testing will be required in case an obscure bug is causing parts of
the data not to be saved out at all. I have not yet run the JUnit tests. When this code is released we should warn in-house users to
watch diffs carefully for lost tags. 

- Assert Implied Links Component
-- Displays impled links table and asserts selected links.
-- Row sorting enabled (ascending and descending) for Child and Parent name columns
-- Clicking the more info icon brings up the explanation for the reasoner made link in the Explanation Component and highlights the link in the Graph Editor

- New Reasoner Modes (IN PROGRESS - WILL BE AVAILABLE in the next release)
-- Two new options that represent step-wise and continuous incremental reasoning
-- Activate incremental reasoning by selecting the "Avtivate Incremental Reasoning" checkbox through the Reasoner Manager
-- Users have a choice between activating continuous incremental reasoning or partial/step reasoning modes. If neither of these options are selected incremental reasoning is off by default.

- New option in Advanced Save - Perform is_a closure (behaviour under testing for various use cases)
-- Performs is_a closure for all cross-referenced terms while saving

- Changed naming coventions for Advanced Save - Save implied links:
-- "Realize links" changed to "Assert Implied Links"
-- "Save for presentation" changed to "Save trimmed links"

- Lock/Unlock Layout option
-- Locking the layout freezes current application layout and prevents addition/removal of components.
 
- Scroll Lock for the Ontology Tree Editor
-- Select any term in the OTE; right-click for Lock View option which enforces a scroll lock on the path currently displayed.

- NEW Configuration directory location: users home directory/oboedit_config

- Cloning behavior corrected - clones now persist on the same branch as the original term.

Frequently Asked Questions
============================

1. Why has the location of the configuration folder changed?
In previous versions of OBO-Edit, the location of the config folder depended on the user's operating system. 
This led to a lot of confusion and most users could not locate their config folder, so we decided to change it 
to a standard location in the file system.

2. What can I do to help?
The success of any software tool is dependent on feedback from the user community.
Here are some ways for you to help improve OBO-Edit:
        * Participate in OBO-Edit Working Group Weekly Meetings held on alternate Tuesday/Thursdays over webex and conference call.
        * You can subscribe to the OEWG meeting calendar here:
https://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=cDN1bXNkOG45bDMyYW5kbGR1M2xqcjNuazhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ&invEmailKey=geneontology-oboedit-working-group%40lists.sourceforge.net%3Af41cf4fbc1e0ab381b88e541f31307dd73d92ab1
        * Join the OBO-Edit Working Group sourceforge mailing list:  
https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=geneontology-oboedit-working-group
        * Report bugs
        * Add or request new features: let us know your ideas for new features or how we can improve existing features.
        * Add documentation
        * Write tutorials and put them up on the OBO-Edit wiki page
        * Help others learn to use OBO-Edit, etc.

3. How can I file a bug report?
If you have reproduced a bug in the most recent release and no one else appears to have reported it, then report it on our SourceForge bug tracker:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418257&group_id=36855&func=browse

Effective bug reports are the most likely to be fixed.
    * Search the Bugs Tracker to check whether your bug has already been reported.
    * Reproduce your bug using the most recent release, to see whether it has already been fixed.
    * Be precise and clear - explain the behavior so others can reproduce the bug.
    * Give specific examples (which ontology file you loaded, exactly what you did that caused the bug to appear, etc.).
    * Report one bug per bug report.
    * No bug is too trivial to report - small bugs may hide big bugs.

4. Where can I find the OBO-Edit source code?
See http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/OBO-Edit:_Getting_the_Source_Code

5. Why haven't you responded to the mail I sent you?
The probability of your question getting answered quickly is the highest 
when you write to the OBO-Edit Working Group Sourceforge Mailing list:
https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=geneontology-oboedit-working-group

6. Who develops OBO-Edit?
Currently, the project manager and lead developer is Nomi Harris of the
Berkeley Bioinformatics and Open Source Projects Group (BBOP) at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California.  The tool was originally
developed by John Day-Richter.  Others who have contributed to the code
include Chris Mungall, Amina Abdulla, and Jennifer Deegan.
