Changes in 2.000-b37
* Delete behavior is pretty much fixed, although the Graph Editor still
occasionally gets confused if you try to delete multiple terms at once (please
report any observed bugs).
- The delete menu item now says "Delete/Destroy term" or "Delete relationship"
(with "Destroy" grayed out--you can't destroy a relationship).
- If you select multiple things, and some are legal to delete and some
aren't, it will offer you the delete option and then only delete the legal
ones (those without children).  It will notify you in the popup about the
term(s) it can't delete.
- The Ontology Tree Editor and the Graph Editor were behaving differently if
you selected a term and then hovered over a different term and right-clicked
and selected Delete.  Now both of them are consistent.  They both disallow
deleteion of an unselected term.  If you are hovering over a term that you
haven't selected, the Delete menu options will be grayed out.

* Fixed Windows problem where built-in icons wouldn't show up.
* Fixed Windows problem where combobox in OTE config window was too tall (but
for some reason the same fix didn't work on the Reasoner Manager combobox).
* Fixed problem where user's memory settings were being lost.  Also bumped up
(from 512M to 1024M) the default memory setting used inside OBO-Edit if it for
some reason can't find/read OBO-Edit.vmoptions where the user-selected memory
setting is stored.
* Configuration setting for "End title of search results panel with" in Search
panel is now saved between sessions.
* At user request, "minus" buttons to remove filters are now below the filters
rather than on the right (where they tend to be invisible unless you have that
panel really stretched out).  Also (again at user request) moved the gear
button ("advanced") so it's to the left of the added field rather than to the
right.
[Need to update screenshots in manual.]
* Reworded two menu options: "Add root" is now "Add root class"; "Add type
root" is now "Add root relation".  (Suggested by Alan Gussman,
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1594409&group_id=36855&atid=418260)
* Now autosave will only save if there are unsaved edits, and it won't grab the
focus and pop to the front.
* "Allow dangling refs" is now true by default, so you can load ontologies
that have dangling refs.  (Dangling refs result in a warning message when you
load and when you save.)
* "Regulates" typedefs in the input file are now roundtripped--they weren't
being saved because I had made the regulates relations built-in and built-ins
aren't saved as typedefs.
If you have an obo file that has regulates relationships without the regulates
typedefs, OBO-Edit would refuse to load it *if* allowDangling is set to false.
However, allowDangling is now true by default.
* Don't write out fake objects that are created from dangling refs.  These were
resulting in [null] stanzas like:
       	      [null]
	      id: FBAR:1234567
I fixed this in OBOSerializationEngine.  Not 100% sure I did this the right
way (Chris will probably let me know if it's not).
* Significantly rearranged configuration options and tabs.  The new layout
makes the user config directory much more obvious, and hopefully is more
logical in general.  Awaiting user feedback.

TODO:
x more prominent (new tab?) config dir in config manager and documentation
  (Need to ok new config manager layout with users)
pull out bug report about color chooser
x make "allow dangling refs" default
  (This needs more testing)
change date parsing (April 10, 2008 3:18:18 PM PDT)

NOT PUTTING IN THIS RELEASE:
* User config files that were stored in ~/.oboeditbeta are now being put in an
OS-appropriate directory:
	       Mac: /Library/Application Support/OBO-Edit2-beta
	       Windows XP or 2000: [user home]\Application Data\OBO-Edit2-beta
	       Windows Vista: [user home]\AppData\Roaming\OBO-Edit2-beta
	       Linux: [user home]/OBO-Edit2-beta
Still need:  copy old .oboeditbeta files to new location
