Changes in 2.000-b31 (2/25/2008):
* Prevented java help indexer from double-indexing pages (it was looking in
  .svn as well as in the html dir), which was resulting in superfluous hits
  when you searched help.
* Committed midori's enhanced dictionary that includes terms from GODict.DAT.
* Height of ID textbox was changing for no apparent reason, causing Jen to
  report the following issue: "When I am working in the text Editor Panel and I
  click somewhere or change a bit of text the top part of the text editor panel
  jiggles up and down continuously."  Now fixed.
* On the search panel, the buttons for new/load/save filter now show the
  correct tooltips when you hover over them.
* New improved icons for clear/load/save filter.
* Changed coloring of tabs.  They were blue with a gradient, which perhaps was
  pretty but was not informative--it was hard to tell which tab was selected.
  Now the unselected tabs are plain gray (no gradient) and the selected one is
  plain blue (no gradient).
  Ultimately, this could be user-configurable.
* Commit words that are added to dictionary to user's dictionary file
  (which now will no longer be in alphabetical order--oh well).
* Fixed: When I choose a term from an autocompletion list, using arrow keys +
  enter to select term, the chosen term changes to some other term from the
  auto-completion list when the search is initiated using return or clicking
  Search.
* I didn't think ConfigurableMessage deserved its own submenu ("Misc"), so I
  moved it to the Config menu (Misc menu now has no items, so doesn't show up).
* Fixed problem that sometimes made it impossible to save ontologies that
  generated warnings during the checks that are performed before saving.
  This was reported as four different bugs, but they all came down to this
  same problem:
  1897062 verification checks stall save b30
  1901239 Problem saving obo file
  1853551 Canceling "Running ID Check" window leaves vestigial windows
  1852713 save messed up
* Title of TextEditor is now black (rather than hard-to-read yellow) when
  there are warnings.  (Warning count shows up in title.)  Title still turns
  red if there are actual errors.
* Main OE window title now includes the text "(REASONER ON)" if the reasoner
  is turned on.
