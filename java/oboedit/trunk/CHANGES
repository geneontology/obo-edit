Changes in 2.000-b42:
- Updated a lot of help pages.
- Chris made it not add SymmetryRule by default.  It was causing the reasoner
to generate zillions of links when it encountered relationships with
"is_symmetric = true" (e.g., "associated_with" in SO), which made reasoning
over these ontologies (SO, fly anatomy, etc.) really slow.
- By default, only one Ontology Tree Editor at a time can be in global
selection mode (i.e., it responds to external selection events).  All others
are in local selection mode (little house icon).
This behavior is configurable in the Configuration Manager.
