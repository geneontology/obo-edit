Changes in b45:
- Searching is now MUCH faster!
- Built-ins (e.g. "xsd:date") are not included in search.
- If you select >200 search results, the OTE doesn't try to select and
show all of them (it just shows the first one).
- Pre-loads relationship icons (when ontology is loaded) for quicker
response the first time you show something in the OTE.  (The slowness
was partly due to having to load the relationship icons.)
- Fixed SF 1944177.  Now when you add a new dbxref, tab moves
circularly between fields, and return commits the current dbxref (and
does not create a new empty dbxref).  [Still need to fix this in
Synonym editor.]
=======
Changes in b46:
- Fixed multi-select in OTE (broken in b45).
- Restored TermFilterEditor to previous version (broke filtering in b45).
- Multi-select in search results now selects all in OTE again.  In b45, it
didn't select all the terms in the tree if you selected >200 objects (because
that is slow).  That didn't work well because it put you in this hybrid state
where they were sort of all selected but didn't look selected in the tree.
- Amina fixed bug #1959537: Save using filter broken for filters which require
reasoner.
- Setting focus for pop-up windows (file managers, status, progress) on linux.

=======
Changes in b47:
Don't automatically start a new dbxref record when user commits the previous
- Fixed dbxref library bug (SF 2025804): adding 3 or more dbxrefs to a term
caused CPU spikes and drawing problems as the Text Editor tried unsuccessfully
to render them.  (For some reason, you only saw this bug if you changed your
default font size!)
- Enabled mass addition of dbxrefs (regular or definition) to all selected
terms (feature request 2032637) from Dbxref Library component.
- Fixed problem that wasted a huge amount of CPU rendering synonyms
that have errors.  I suspect that this was a major cause of the CPU
spikes that midori was seeing, because she said she was adding/editing
synonyms.
- Jen has improved the Graphviz component.  Config settings are now
accessed via the wrench icon instead of the archaic options button.
- When dragging term(s) in the OTE, the drag target must be obsolete
to show the menu items "Add/Consider replacement".
- Don't automatically start a new dbxref record when user commits the previous one--let them do that if they want to.
- "Cyclical" relationships shown in OTE with double-headed arrow
icons.
- Fixed: If you start up OE with the reasoner on (from the previous session),
it doesn't show that in the titlebar until you load an ontology (SF 2048191).

=======
Changes in b48:
- Fixed "bouncing" synonym display when editing neighboring synonyms (SF bug
2057430).
- When run from the command line on Mac, OE now shows up in the dock with the
OBO-Edit icon rather than the boring gray "exec" icon.
- Layout menu now has "Import perspective" to add a new perspective (from an
.idw file).  (The instructions on the Perspectives help page for adding a new
perspective were incomplete.)

amina:
- Fixed Semantic Parser Manager startup bug

- Modified Search Panel checkbox to "Indicate if selected term matches filter" which is its exact function - the lightbulb switches on when the currently selected term in the OTE, Graph Editor or Search Results Panel match the corresponding filter. This can be useful when multiple filters are in use and the Search Results are designed to show the "Matches all" case and would be interesting to get an indication of "Matches any" terms with the lightbulb swiching on while browsing an ontology.

- Fixed Bug: [ 1986916 ] Explanations component should be disabled if reasoner off
There aren't any explanations when the reasoner is not ON and therefore explanations component menu item is enabled only when the reasoner is ON and grayed out otherwise.
