- Graphviz uses a lot of memory when you assign dbxrefs: ID: 2057452
The Graphviz interface redraws have been removed for the bulk addition of dbxrefs. 
Now there is only one redraw at the end of the bulk process.

NOTES:
* Config directory - now located in the users home directory and called oboedit_config


FEATURES:
* Assert Implied Links Component
** Displays impled links table and asserts selected links.
** Row sorting enabled (ascending and descending) for Child and Parent name columns
** Clicking the more info icon brings up the explanation for the reasoner made link in the Explanation Component and highlights the link in the Graph Editor

* New Reasoner Modes (IN PROGRESS - WILL BE AVAILABLE in 2.1)
** Two new options that represent step-wise and continuous incremental reasoning
** Activate incremental reasoning by selecting the "Avtivate Incremental Reasoning" checkbox through the Reasoner Manager
** Users have a choice between activating continuous incremental reasoning or partial/step reasoning modes. If neither of these options are selected incremental reasoning is off by default.

* Lock/Unlock Layout option
** Locking the layout freezes current application layout and prevents addition/removal of components.
 
* Scroll Lock for the Ontology Tree Editor
** Select any term in the OTE; right-click for Lock View option which enforces a scroll lock on the path currently displayed.

* NEW Configuration directory location: users home directory/oboedit_config

Added new feature to OBOMerge so that it reports if any term has been edited in both the live and branch files. 


Added new feature to TermMergeHistoryItem, so it can update substitution tags that mention any term that
is in the process of being subsumed in a merge. This fixes this bug: ID: 2790775
