Changes in 2.000-b40:
- Fixed command-click bug (1887110):
The option to add relationships, move, etc. by [command]-clicking the target
just doesn't work. I select one term, and when I select a second term to be
the target, I get the same menu as when I right-click a single term -- no
options to add parent, add child, move or merge. It also looks as though
the first (source) term is spontaneously deselected.
The problem was that if you use command-click (on a one-button mouse) to
simulate right-click, java.swing.SwingUtilities.isLeftMouseButton returns true
(and so does java.swing.SwingUtilities.isRightMouseButton), which resulted in
the wrong behavior.
- Got rid of the "Garbage" tabs that were showing up if you had search results
in your layout when you last quit.
- Made Term Image Display Panel a real OBO-Edit component rather than a
plug-in.  The user doesn't have to do anything to install it.
    - Term Image Display Panel now clears if you select a term that doesn't have
    an image associated with it.
    - Included some sample term images in jar.  These are installed in the images
    directory in your oboedit configuration directory, if you don't yet have one.
    - Ask people for other term images.  Eventually, should have a stable URL
    from which term images can be loaded.
