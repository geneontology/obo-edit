Changes in 2.000-b33:
* Tried to fix overzealous delete bug, where deleting (in the Ontology Editor
Panel) one relationship from a term that had two relationships would cause the
term to be silently deleted.  Unfortunately, it's not completely fixed.
Shouldn't allow user to delete/destroy a term that has REAL children--but if
it has only obsolete children (why does it still have them if they are
obsolete?), that's ok.
Also, it's not always warning that a term is about to become obsolete.  This
needs more work.
Test case:  load so.obo, find insertion, show parents (in graph view).  Then
in OEP, say "Delete" (which should delete the relationship that is shown but
not "insertion" itself).
* Changed some confusing component names as follows:
Ontology Editor Panel -> Ontology Tree Editor
Graph Editor -> (Graph Editor) (unchanged) [added preliminary web page]
Graph DAG View -> Graph Viewer [added preliminary web page]
DAG Viewer -> Tree Viewer
Graphviz Viewer -> (unchanged) [web page was called Graph Viewer]
* Tree Viewer (was called DAG View) now comes up as a docked component rather
than a free-floating one.
* Couldn't specify on the command line an obo file to load.  I got this
working in a rather kludgy special-case way (because I couldn't figure out the
baroque argument parsing approach that oboedit uses--obomerge and its siblings
use a more comprehensible approach, and oboedit should probably switch to
using that method, but I wasn't up for doing all the work to convert it).
You can now say "oboedit foo.obo" and it will automatically load foo.obo.
* Fixed problem with ontologies that have dangling references: "Having even a
single dangling reference in a file (an intersection_of line which refers to a
term from another ontology, not currently loaded) is sufficient to screw up
term selection from the ontology editor panel. No term info is shown in the
text editor window. No graphs are shown in the graph editor or the graph dag
view."  (The problem was that exceptions were flying because the dangling
terms are assigned null as their names.)
* Prevented java help indexer from double-indexing pages (it was including
docs/.svn and docs/api, so the ant target now moves those out of the way as
well as docs/html/.svn), which was resulting in superfluous hits when you
searched help.
* Added icon candidates for regulates, positively_regulates,
negatively_regulates.  For now, defaults are regs-square.svg, upregs-arrow.svg
(green), and downregs-arrow.svg (reddish), respectively.  Other candidates are
included in release; use "Browse built-in icons" to view.
I had a pick a link color for the regulates relations.  For now, they're all
maroon.  Let me know what they should be.
* Included obo-mapper (added by Chris) in release.  Needs to be invoked from
the shell rather than by double-clicking because it requires arguments.
