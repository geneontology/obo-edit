Changes in b49:

- Fixed bug 2026858: Gray terms in OTE after removing parent in Parent Editor.  
Fix is in PathUtil.pathIsCircular:  it doesn't count as a circular path if the
relationship leading to the already-visited child is symmetric (disjoint_from
or inverse of).

Features:
- [ 2086577 ] add parent to filter menu
Adding "Parent" to search panel - enables searching for terms with a given parent.
