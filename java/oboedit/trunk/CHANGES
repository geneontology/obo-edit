Changes in 2.000-b43:
- Implemented local/global selection modes for Graph Viewer.
- "Change relationships" now works for multiple selections.
- Fixed the ability to remove filters that are present at startup.  (I had fixed this
previously in a less-good way that broke some filter-changing functionality in the
graph editor.)
- Fixed quick filtering ("f" button) for OTE and Graph Editor (lets you filter
by relationship).
- Got "remove filters and renderers" menu items working for OTE.
- Reduced number of gratuitous reloads in OTE and Graph Editor--might speed
things up a bit.
- Fixed bug #2025804: can't add more than two definition dbxrefs from the
Dbxref Library tool.  
I fixed this by getting rid of the call to setBorder in
DbxrefTableRenderer.configureLabel (which makes some space around each dbxref
line).  I don't understand why this fixes the bug.
The only effect of commenting out that call (other than fixing the bug) is
that the dbxrefs appear close together rather than spaced out.  That seems
tolerable to me.
- Put name and ID of currently selected term at top of Parent Editor.
- Don't allow user to drop currently selected term into Parent Editor (which
would make the term a parent of itself).
- Fixed link searching--was excluding intersection links.
