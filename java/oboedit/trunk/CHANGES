Changes in 2.000-b43 (released 8/1/2008):
- Implemented local/global selection modes for Graph Viewer.
- "Change relationships" now works for multiple selections.
- Fixed the ability to remove filters that are present at startup.  (I had
fixed this previously in a less-good way that broke some filter-changing
functionality in the graph editor.)
- Fixed quick filtering ("f" button) for OTE and Graph Editor (lets you filter
by relationship).
- Got "remove filters and renderers" menu items working for OTE.
- Reduced number of gratuitous reloads in OTE and Graph Editor--might speed
things up a bit.
- Fixed bug #2025804: can't add more than two definition dbxrefs from the
Dbxref Library tool.  
I fixed this by getting rid of the call to setBorder in
DbxrefTableRenderer.configureLabel (which makes some space around each dbxref
line).  I don't understand why this fixes the bug.
The only effect of commenting out that call (other than fixing the bug) is
that the dbxrefs appear close together rather than spaced out.  That seems
tolerable to me.
- Fixed bug #2023468 : if you had two OTEs in local mode, and you changed one
of them to global, BOTH of them would show the current selection (the one
that's still local mode shouldn't change).
- Fixed link searching--was excluding intersection links.  (This appeared to
be a deliberate choice--we're not sure why it was done that way.)
- Fixes to Parent Editor:
  - Put name and ID of currently selected term at top of Parent Editor.
  - Don't allow user to drop currently selected term into Parent Editor (which
  would make the term a parent of itself).
  - "Show implied links" checkbox is grayed out if the reasoner is off
  - Current term stays selected in (global) OTE after you add parents (fix for
  bug #2010708)
