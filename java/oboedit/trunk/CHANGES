* Made file browser for load/save open at last used directory (rather than
  always at your home directory).
* Searches were sensitive to whitespace at the end of the search string, so if
  you searched for "term ", rather than "term", it wouldn't find anything.
  Now whitespace is trimmed from the beginning and end of the search string.
  (Requested by M. Ashburner.)
* Fixed sub-selection problem where you couldn't change the sub-selection
  without de-selecting most of the other selected terms.
* Made sub-selection behavior more consistent:  the sub-selection is now the
  term that you most recently selected (rather than the one that happened to
  be alphabetically first, or a random one).  Note that this involves using
  LinkedHashSets rather than HashSets to store the selected links and terms,
  which maintains their order but can run slower.
* Mostly fixed the sub-selection coloring problem, where there were multiple
  darker highlights even though there can only be one sub-selection at a time;
  however, there is still a minor problem: if you deselect your current
  sub-selection, you can end up with nothing highlighted in the darker color,
  even though there is still a sub-selection.
* By request, added result count at end of search results title ("Search
  results: all_text_fields contains "foo" (0 matches)").  This should also
  address the issue of the blank window you get when there are no matches
  (which a user complained about), since that will now be apparent from the "0
  matches" text.  If users find the extra length of the title annoying, I can
  make this configurable or try to make the tab title different from the
  component title (at the moment, they're always the same).
* Search text description wasn't including NOT when search is for terms that
  "don't have" something.
* Got rid of platform-independent release.  This was motivated by a bug where
  the platform-independent version couldn't find the sample ontology file
  (which used a relative path: test_resources/camphor_catabolism.obo) because
  it didn't know where to look relative to.  Fixing this would have been
  non-trivial.  After discussing the issue with the OBO-Edit community, we
  concluded that there's really no need for the platform-independent version.
  (The generic unix version works on Solaris as well as other unixes.)
  (NOTE: will reinstate platform-independent release if there is demand from
  users, e.g. Mike Cherry)
