Added new feature to OBOMerge so that it reports if any term has been edited in both the live and branch files. 
This feature is quite difficult to comprehensively test, so I am having some trouble figuring out whether it is completely
finished. However I have been setting up a large collection of test files that enabled me to test many 
types of edit. The files are in GO cvs at \go\software\test_resources\OBO-Edit.

Added new feature to TermMergeHistoryItem, so it can update substitution tags that mention any term that
is in the process of being subsumed in a merge. This fixes this bug: ID: 2790775
