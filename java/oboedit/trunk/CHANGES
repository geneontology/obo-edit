Changes in 2.000-b38 (4/17/2008):
* allowDangling is now true by default for both reading and writing.
* Dangling objects don't get name (= id) in the output.  (Also fixed a
bug introducted in b37 where dangling objects didn't print their
relationships.)
* Improved layout of Advanced interface for saving OBO files (wasn't
providing enough room for checkboxes).  It's still not perfect--if you
add both term and link filters, it gets crowded, and if you don't,
it's overly stretched.  Would like to have the size adjust more
dynamically.
* Made Text Editor titlebar error text color a darker red (for Jen).
* Made TextIcons (black & white icons used in the Ontology Tree Editor
for unknown relationships) readable.  Font is now based on user's
preferred font.  (Note: not yet fixed in Graph Editor.)
* Ontology Tree Editor now uses your preferred font for the text in
the tree.  (Note: not yet fixed in Graph Editor and other components.)
* OBO_1_2 serializer now outputs dates in ISO 8601 format:
yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ss'Z' (e.g., 2008-04-17T04:04:00Z)
OBO reader can now handle both old date format (dd:MM:yyyy HH:mm) and
new.
* Cloning somehow broke--need to fix in next release.
