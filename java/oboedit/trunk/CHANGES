* Prevented java help indexer from double-indexing pages (it was looking in
  .svn as well as in the html dir), which was resulting in superfluous hits
  when you searched help.
* Committed midori's enhanced dictionary that includes terms from GODict.DAT.
* Height of ID textbox was changing for no apparent reason, causing Jen to
  report the following issue: "When I am working in the text Editor Panel and I
  click somewhere or change a bit of text the top part of the text editor panel
  jiggles up and down continuously."  Now fixed.
* On the search panel, the buttons for new/load/save filter now show the
  correct tooltips when you hover over them.
* New improved icons for clear/load/save filter.
* Changed coloring of tabs.  They were blue with a gradient, which perhaps was
  pretty but was not informative--it was hard to tell which tab was selected.
  Now the unselected tabs are plain gray (no gradient) and the selected one is
  plain blue (no gradient).
  Ultimately, this could be user-configurable.
