Changes in b46:
- Fixed multi-select in OTE (broken in b45).
- Restored TermFilterEditor to previous version (broke filtering in b45).
- Multi-select in search results now selects all in OTE again.  In b45, it
didn't select all the terms in the tree if you selected >200 objects (because
that is slow).  That didn't work well because it put you in this hybrid state
where they were sort of all selected but didn't look selected in the tree.
- Amina fixed bug #1959537: Save using filter broken for filters which require
reasoner.
