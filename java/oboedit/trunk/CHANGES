Changes in 2.000-b35-36:
* "Regulates" links are now purple; "part_of" links are orange.
* Delete behavior mostly fixed:
- it now differentiates between selecting a relationship to delete and
selecting a term to delete.
- you cannot delete a term that has children.
- whenever you are about to delete a term, you will get the "this term will
become obsolete" warning.
- in the Ontology Term Editor, if the term-relationship you have selected
is the only relationship for that term, it counts as selecting a term.
(that means that for singletons, you can only delete the term, since they
don't have relationships.)  if a term has multiple parents (i.e., appears
multiple times in the tree), you can't delete the term.  selecting one of
the instances of the term in the tree counts as deleting that relationship,
not that term.
- the delete menu item now says "delete relationship" or "delete term"
depending on what will be deleted if you go through with it.
- "delete relationship" will never make a term obsolete, though it may make
it a singleton.
- if you select multiple things, and some are legal to delete and some
aren't, it will offer you the delete option and then only delete the legal
ones.  i would probably choose not to let the user delete anything if
multiple things are selected, but clearly it was set up to allow this.
- in the Graph Editor, you can select either a relationship or a term.  you
are allowed to delete a term if you've selected it, even if it has multiple
parents (though, as above, not if it has any children).
HOWEVER, the thing that isn't working right is that in the graph editor,
you can right-mouse over an item that isn't really selected (it doesn't
have a blue border around it) and the item it will try to delete is the one
that is selected, NOT the one you are currently hovering over.

* Terms with dangling refs now are labeled in graph editor with their IDs
(since they don't have names).
* Dangling objects were causing lots of exceptions to fly.  Fixed these by
making DanglingObjectImpl extend OBOClassImpl.  This fixed one of David S's
problems:
(a) These result in a very long line of empty boxes in the graph editor. 
If the reasoner is turned on, the first box clicked prompts the Text Editor
to show a dangling ID (& said boxes do this cute little shuffling thing
when clicked). After this, the Text Editor sticks on the orginally chosen
term - and fails to respond to new selection from the ontology tree editor
or the graph editor.
* Made background of ID field the same as the component background (light
gray) so that it's clear that it's not editable.
* Fixed (I think) Windows-only appearance problem with pulldown list in
Search config (bug #1897924).  (Can't test.)
