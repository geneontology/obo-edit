	* Default save format for OBO-Edit and obomerge is now OBO_1_2
	* Restored "are you sure?" warning when user tries to destroy a term
	* Fixed exception that was thrown if you tried to delete or destroy
	  from the Ontology Editor panel
	* Command-S is now a shortcut for "Save As" (pending the
	  implementation of "Save")
	* Made oboedit and obomerge actually use oboedit.vmoptions and obomerge.vmoptions
        * Removed command-T keyboard shortcut for "change relationship type"
  	  because it didn't work and it didn't make sense to have a keyboard
	  shortcut for it anyway (according to Midori).
	* Fixed platform-independent release:
	  - Includes test_resources directory
	  - Includes oboedit.vmoptions (so that oboedit launches with enough memory)
	* Installer now successfully creates desktop icon for OBO-Edit
	* Pop-up help windows that appear when you click the ? icon on a panel
	  titlebar are now real windows, which can be dragged around, resized,
