Changes in 2.000-b43:
- "Change relationships" now works for multiple selections.
- Fixed the ability to remove filters that are present at startup.  (I had fixed this
previously in a less-good way that broke some filter-changing functionality in the
graph editor.)
- Fixed quick filtering ("f" button) for OTE and Graph Editor.
- Got "remove filters and renderers" menu items working for OTE.
- Reduced number of gratuitous reloads in OTE and Graph Editor--might speed
things up a bit.
