/**
 * This basic function of this class is to return a Method object for a
 * particular class given the name of a method and the parameters to the method
 * in the form of an Object[]
 * 
 * The first time the Introspector sees a class it creates a class method map
 * for the class in question. Basically the class method map is a Hastable where
 * Method objects are keyed by a concatenation of the method name and the names
 * of classes that make up the parameters.
 * 
 * For example, a method with the following signature:
 * 
 * public void method(String a, StringBuffer b)
 * 
 * would be mapped by the key:
 * 
 * "method" + "java.lang.String" + "java.lang.StringBuffer"
 * 
 * This mapping is performed for all the methods in a class and stored for
