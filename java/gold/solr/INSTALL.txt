* There are two installation methods described 
* in this document. 

*************METHOD ONE FOR INSTALLATION**************************
This method can be used in all OS platforms, i.e Ubuntu, OSX and Windows. 
This method is suitable for developers. 

- Step 1: Download Jetty from http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty/
- Step 2: Extract the downloaded jetty compress file and move the contents of 
			the root directory to {USER.HOME}/jetty. The USER.HOME is the home
			directory of a user in a OS. The directory path {USER.HOME}/jetty in this 
			documentation is referred as jetty.home.
- Step 3: Run the 'ant dist' (from this project source directory) command on shell to 
			build distribution of this solr project. 
- Step 4: Copy dist/solr.war file (from this project source) to jetty.home/webapps directory.
- Step 5: Cop dit/sorl (from this project source) directory to jetty.home director
- Step 6: Change the jetty.home/sorl/conf/go-data-config.xml file to update the location of the obo file
			in your computer.
- Step 6: run the command 'java -jar start.jar' from the jetty.home
- Step 7: Visit the 'http://localhost:8080/solr/dataimport?command=full-import' from  a web browser.
			This command index the obo ontology file in solr.
- Step 8: Visit the 'http://localhost:8080/solr/admin' for searching in the solr index.




*************METHOD TWO FOR INSTALLATION**************************

* Installation instructions for Ubuntu 10.04.
** Get the necessary libraries and installations.

   sudo apt-get -u install solr-jetty libmysql-java

** Get Jetty into a usable state.

Edit /etc/default/jetty and change NO_START to be 0 (or comment it out).

** Get Sol into a usable state.

Edit ./solr/gold-pg-config.xml to reflect your setup. This is likely
to just be changing a couple of entries in dataConfig/dataSource for the
JDBC driver.

** Move Apache/Solr/Jetty configuration files into place.

Either load golr.el and run "M-x golr-restart" or run the following:
   
   sudo cp apache/golr /etc/apache2/sites-available/golr
   sudo cp jetty/jetty.conf /etc/jetty/jetty.conf
   sudo cp jetty/jetty-rewrite.xml /etc/jetty/jetty-rewrite.xml
   sudo cp jetty/no_access.html /var/lib/jetty/webapps/root/no_access.html
   sudo cp solr/schema.xml /etc/solr/conf/schema.xml
   sudo cp solr/solrconfig.xml /etc/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml
   sudo /etc/init.d/jetty stop
   sudo /etc/init.d/jetty start
   sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Please note that sometimes it takes a very long time for Jetty to
restart, so you may want to wait a bit before executing the next step.
   
** Update the Lucene index with the current 

Either load golr.el and run "M-x golr-update" or visit the following:

   http://localhost:8080/solr/dataimport?command=full-import

Of course, replace localhost with the appropriate string for your setup.
