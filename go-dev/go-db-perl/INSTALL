The easiest way to install this module is via the cpan command line tool. Just type:

        cpan GO::AppHandle

on the command line. You may need special permissions to install; if
you have sudo permission you can do this:

        sudo cpan GO::AppHandle

You can also install manually as follows:

First download this library from CPAN:

L<http://search.cpan.org/~cmungall/go-db-perl/>

then:

  cd go-db-perl-X-XX
  perl Makefile.PL

you will be prompted with questions about your local go database
installation. If you do not wish to run the test suite, you can skip
these options (hit return)

Then type

  make install

You can then write programs that use the GO::AppHandle API, or you can
use the GOshell.pl script or any of the other scripts which have been
installed

NOTES:

Some people have reported the test suite fails - it's easiest to get
this working if you have liberal access policies to a local database

Currently scripts are installed with 

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

in the header. These may need to be manually changed
