In the current ontology, these include stoichiometric coefficient and cellular location.  For example, in the interaction describing the transport of L-arginine into the cytoplasm in E. coli, the LEFT slot in the interaction would be filled with an instance of physicalEntityParticipant that specified the location of L-arginine as periplasm and the stoichiometric coefficient as one.</rdfs:comment>

Examples of this class include the assembling of the TFB2 and TFB3 proteins into the TFIIH complex, and the assembly of the ribosome through aggregation of its subunits.

NOTE: This class is also used to represent complex disassembly. The direction in which the complexAssembly occurs (toward either assembly or disassembly) is specified via either the SPONTANEOUS slot or the DIRECTION slot (in the catalysis class), depending on whether the interaction occurs spontaneously or must be catalyzed in order to occur.

NOTE:  The following are not examples of complex assembly: Covalent phosphorylation of a protein (this is a biochemicalReaction), the TFIIH complex itself (this is an instance of the complex class, not the complexAssembly class).</rdfs:comment>

    >A unification defines a reference to an entity in an external resource that has the same biological identity as the referring entity. For example, if one wished to link from a database record, C, describing a chemical compound in a BioPAX data collection to a record, C', describing the same chemical compound in an external database, one would use a unification xref since records C and C' describe the same biological identity. Generally, unification xrefs should be used whenever possible, although there are cases where they might not be useful, such as application to application data exchange.

NOTE: Unification xrefs in physical entities are essential for data integration, but are less important in interactions. This is because unification xrefs on the physical entities in an interaction can be used to compute the equivalence of two interactions of the same type.

NOTE: An xref in a protein pointing to a gene, e.g. in the LocusLink database, would not be a unification xref since the two entities do not have the same biological identity (one is a protein, the other is a gene).  Instead, this link should be a captured as a relationship xref.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>A control interaction in which a physical entity modulates a catalysis interaction. Biologically, most modulation interactions describe an interaction in which a small molecule alters the ability of an enzyme to catalyze a specific reaction. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a modulating entity and a catalysis interaction.  A separate modulation instance should be created for each different catalysis that a physical entity may modulate and for each different physical entity that may modulate a catalysis instance.  A typical modulation instance has a small molecule as the controller entity and a catalysis instance as the controlled entity. Examples of instances of this class include allosteric activation and competitive inhibition of an enzyme's ability to catalyze a specific reaction.</rdfs:comment>

A transport interaction does not include the transporter entity, even if one is required in order for the transport to occur.  Instead, transporters are linked to transport interactions via the catalysis class.  A synonym for the transport class is 'translocation'.  One example of this class is the movement of Na+ into the cell through an open voltage-gated channel.

    <rdfs:comment>A physical entity whose structure is comprised of other physical entities bound to each other non-covalently, at least one of which is a macromolecule (protein or RNA). Complexes must be stable enough to function as a biological unit; in general, the temporary association of an enzyme with its substrate(s) should not be considered or represented as a complex. A complex is the physical product of an interaction (complex assembly), thus is not an interaction itself. Examples of this class include complexes of multiple protein monomers and complexes of proteins and small molecules.

NOTE: Complexes can be defined recursively to describe smaller complexes within larger complexes, e.g., a participant in a complex can itself be a complex. 

NOTE: The boundaries on the size of complexes described by this class are not defined here, although elements of the cell as large and dynamic as, e.g., a mitochondrion would typically not be described using this class (later versions of this ontology may include a cellularComponent class to represent these).  The strength of binding of the components is also not described.</rdfs:comment>

For example, in the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system, transportation of sugar into an E. coli cell is accompanied by the sugar's phosphorylation as it crosses the plasma membrane.  Also, active transporters that use ATP as an energy source fall under this category, even if the only covalent change is the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP.</rdfs:comment>

    >An entity that has a physical structure. This class serves as the super-class for all physical entities, although its current set of subclasses is limited to molecules. Physical entities are frequent building blocks of interactions. As a highly abstract class in the ontology, instances of the physicalEntity class should be created rarely, if ever.

CLASS-DESIGN-RATIONALE: It's difficult to find a name that encompasses all of the subclasses of this class without being too general. E.g. PSI-MI uses interactor, BIND uses object, BioCyc uses chemicals.  physicalEntity seems to be a good specialization of entity.

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="biochemicalReaction">
    <rdfs:comment>A conversion interaction in which one or more entities (substrates) undergo covalent changes to become one or more other entities (products).  The substrates of biochemical reactions are defined in terms of sums of species. This is what is typically done in biochemistry, and, in principle, all of the EC reactions should be biochemical reactions. 

Example: ATP + H2O = ADP + Pi.

In this reaction, ATP is considered to be an equilibrium mixture of several species, namely ATP4-, HATP3-, H2ATP2-, MgATP2-, MgHATP-, and Mg2ATP. Additional species may also need to be considered if other ions (e.g. Ca2+) that bind ATP are present. Similar considerations apply to ADP and to inorganic phosphate (Pi). When writing biochemical reactions, it is important not to attach charges to the biochemical reactants and not to include ions such as H+ and Mg2+ in the equation. The reaction is written in the direction specified by the EC nomenclature system, if applicable, regardless of the physiological direction(s) in which the reaction proceeds. (This definition from EcoCyc)

NOTE: Polymerization reactions involving large polymers whose structure is not explicitly captured should generally be represented as unbalanced reactions in which the monomer is consumed but the polymer remains unchanged, e.g. glycogen + glucose = glycogen.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="catalysis">
    <rdfs:comment>A control interaction in which a physical entity (a catalyst) increases the rate of a conversion interaction by lowering its activation energy. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a catalyzing entity and a catalyzed conversion. A separate catalysis instance should be created for each different conversion that a physical entity may catalyze and for each different physical entity that may catalyze a conversion. For example, a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two different biochemical reactions would be linked to each of those biochemical reactions by two separate instances of the catalysis class. 
Typically, each step in a metabolic pathway is either an instance of the catalysis class or a spontaneous conversion, which occurs under biological conditions without the aid of a catalyzing entity. Synonyms for this class include 'facilitation' and 'acceleration'. Examples of this class include the catalysis of a biochemical reaction by an enzyme, the enabling of a transport interaction by a membrane pore complex, and the facilitation of a complex assembly by a scaffold protein.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:ID="DIRECTION">
    <rdfs:comment>Specifies the reaction direction of the interaction catalyzed by this instance of the catalysis class.

Possible values of this slot are:

REVERSIBLE: Interaction occurs in both directions in physiological settings.

PHYSIOL-LEFT-TO-RIGHT
PHYSIOL-RIGHT-TO-LEFT
The interaction occurs in the specified direction in physiological settings,  because of several possible factors including the energetics of the reaction, local concentrations
of reactants and products, and the regulation of the enzyme or its expression.

IRREVERSIBLE-LEFT-TO-RIGHT
IRREVERSIBLE-RIGHT-TO-LEFT
For all practical purposes, the interactions occurs only in the specified direction in physiological settings, because of chemical properties of the reaction.

The following terms are possible values:

ACTIVATION:  General activation

The following term can not be used in the catalysis class:
INHIBITION: General inhibition

The following terms can only be used in the modulation class:
INHIBITION-ALLOSTERIC
Allosteric inhibitors decrease the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that decreases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.  Allosteric inhibitors can be competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors, therefore, those inhibition categories can be used in conjunction with this category.

INHIBITION-COMPETITIVE
Competitive inhibitors are compounds that competitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.  A competitive inhibitor can either bind to the active site of the enzyme, directly excluding the substrate from binding there, or it can bind to another site on the enzyme, altering the conformation of the enzyme such that the substrate can not bind to the active site.

INHIBITION-IRREVERSIBLE
Irreversible inhibitors are compounds that irreversibly inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding to the enzyme and dissociating so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents, such as iodoacetamide, irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.

INHIBITION-NONCOMPETITIVE
Noncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that noncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme by binding reversibly to both the free enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other. However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.

INHIBITION-OTHER
Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized, but that cannot be clearly classified as irreversible, competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, or allosteric.

INHIBITION-UNCOMPETITIVE
Uncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that uncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex but not to the enzyme alone.

INHIBITION-UNKMECH
Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism.  The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.

ACTIVATION-UNKMECH
Compounds that activate the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism.  The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.

ACTIVATION-NONALLOSTERIC
Nonallosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by means other than allosteric.

ACTIVATION-ALLOSTERIC
Allosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:ID="KEQ">
    <rdfs:comment>The measured equilibrium constant for a biochemical reaction, encoded by the slot KEQ, is actually the apparent equilibrium constant, K'.  Concentrations in the equilibrium constant equation refer to the total concentrations of  all forms of particular biochemical reactants. For example, in the equilibrium constant equation for the biochemical reaction in which ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate:

K' = [ADP][P&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub>]/[ATP],

The concentration of ATP refers to the total concentration of all of the following species:

[ATP] = [ATP&lt;sup>4-&lt;/sup>] + [HATP&lt;sup>3-&lt;/sup>] + [H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>ATP&lt;sup>2-&lt;/sup>] + [MgATP&lt;sup>2-&lt;/sup>] + [MgHATP&lt;sup>-&lt;/sup>] + [Mg&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>ATP].

The apparent equilibrium constant is formally dimensionless, and can be kept so by inclusion of as many of the terms (1 mol/dm&lt;sup>3&lt;/sup>) in the numerator or denominator as necessary.  It is a function of temperature (T), ionic strength (I), pH, and pMg (pMg = -log&lt;sub>10&lt;/sub>[Mg&lt;sup>2+&lt;/sup>]). Therefore, these quantities must be specified, and values for KEQ for biochemical reactions are represented as 5-tuples of the form (K' T I pH pMg).  This slot may have multiple values, representing different measurements for K' obtained under the different experimental conditions listed in the 5-tuple.
