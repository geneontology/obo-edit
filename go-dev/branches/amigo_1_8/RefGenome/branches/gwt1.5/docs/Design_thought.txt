1. RefGenomeView is the major class which implements the WebViewI interface. It is composed of 
multiple views ....

TitlePanelView : Displays the title
LoginPanleView : Displays the login toolbar

NavPanelView : It contains the search and browse components.
 SearchPanelView: Placeholder for tools(buttons/forms) for doing the searches.
 BrowsePanelView: Placeholder for tools(buttons/links) for browsing dataset.
 
 
ResultPanelView: Where the result will be displayed, such as lists, tables etc.

2. The views communicate with each other by passing the RefGenomeView object to each instances
   of each child views. The parent RefGenomeView has some handy accessors(get based) to access
   the other view object. 
   
3. The view communicates with the server side through RefGenomeViewListenerI interface methods.
   Each view constructor receives a RefGenomeClientImplI class which is extends the above
   interface. 
   
   
   
View -> Server communication
-----------------------------

As mentioned earlier, this is done via RefGenomeViewListenerI interface and RefGenomeClientImplI
class. Each of its interface calls(such as doLogin) dispatch it to server side through rpc along
with a Async callback inner class which handles the server response.

Example:
  public void doLogin(String user, String pass) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		refgservice.checkUserPassword(user, pass, new LoginCallback());
		
	}
