XSL Transformations
===================

These are XSLT files for transforming the XML formats produced by the
GO and OBO projects.

In order to use these files you will need an xslt processor. I use
xsltproc, which comes as part of libxml and libxml2.

If you have xsltproc on your system, you can also use
go-dev/scripts/go-apply-xslt. (If you wish to use a different xslt
processor, email me and I will make go-apply-xslt more generic)

  go-apply-xslt oboxml_to_owl MyFile.obo-xml


These transformations work off of OBO XML, *not* the deprecated GO RDF
XML file format.

To transform flatfiles into OBO XML you can use the go2xml script,
which is part of the go-perl distro.

EXAMPLES
========

To generate OWL from an OBO XML file, do this

  go2xml go.obo | xsltproc $GO_ROOT/xml/xsl/oboxml_to_owl.xsl -

To generate go-database xml ready to be be loaded into the db, do this

  go2xml go.obo | xsltproc $GO_ROOT/xml/xsl/oboxml_to_godb_prestore.xsl -

This will also work on gene assocition files

  go2xml gene_association.wb | xsltproc $GO_ROOT/xml/xsl/oboxml_to_godb_prestore.xsl -
