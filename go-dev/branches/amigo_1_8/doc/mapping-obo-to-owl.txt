- 2004-02-02 :
- 2004-02-16 : 
- 2005-03-15 : finalised intersection_of mapping
- 2005-12-01 : updated to reflect latest obo 1.2 spec

Note: this page will soon become obsolete, as soon as the mappings
proposed
http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/OboInOwl:Main_Page[Here] are
adoped and used in go-perl

About
-----

This document describes the mapping between the OBO 1.2 file format and
the OWL W3C standard ontology language. The mapping is available as an
XSLT file here:

- http://www.godatabase.org/dev/xml/xsl/oboxml_to_owl.xsl[XSLT]

Documentation on the OBO 1.2 file format can be found here:

- http://www.godatabase.org/dev/doc/obo_format_spec.html[OBO-1_2]

(this spec is not yet finalised)

Downloading ontologies in OWL
-----------------------------

GO in OWL
~~~~~~~~~

OWL downloads of the daily and monthly builds of the GO Database are
available from the go-dev website. These are purely syntactic
conversions. Currently all OBO ontologies use only a small subset of
the OBO formalism, and hence only corresponds to a small subset of
OWL.

- http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database[GO-Database]

(look for the file marked go_YYYYMM-termdb.owl.gz)

Other OBO ontologies in OWL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Daily exports of most OBO ontologies into OWL can be found here:

- http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies[OBO-Download]

Ontologies are placed in the http://purl.org/obo/owl URI-space, unless
overridden by the ontology

Individual OBO ontologies can be downloaded, or the entire set can be
downloaded in OWL from the ftp site above.

This is not a stable URL - this service will soon be subsumed into the
services provided by the new National Center for Biomedical Ontologies
(http://www.ncbo.us[NCBiO]).

Inferred DL definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Semantic conversions, including automated inference of class
definitions are available from the Obol page. Note that these are
automated, highly experimental and subject to change.

- http://www.berkeleybop.org/obol[Obol]

Status of mapping
-----------------

Not complete. Reasonably stable - any new changes introduced from here
on should be backwards compatible

need to add more AnnotationProperties to capture missing aspects of
the OBO 1.2 model, eg synonyms.

Identifiers
-----------

OWL is layered over RDF/RDFS. The OBO identifier model is consistent
with the RDF/XML identifier model.

An OBO identifier consists of an idspace and a local ID (eg GO and
0008045). These are normally flattened using a colon separator,
e.g. GO:0008045. An idspace can have both short and long forms. The
short form would be unique within OBO, the long form would be
a guaranteed globally unique URI prefix. 

The current OWL mapping simply substitutes the ':' for a '_' in the
ID, and prepends a generic URI prefix.

In future this will be changed. The RDF/XML ID will be composed of the
idspace URI (corresponding to XML namespace) and the local ID
(e.g. http://www.geneontology.org/GO#0008045, or whatever URI scheme
we choose to use). The idspace short form (eg GO) will be used as the
XML namespace qname.

OBO Terms
-----------

An OBO term is signified with the stanza [Term] in the OBO
flatfile. In Obo-XML the corresponding element is <term>

All OBO terms correspond to <owl:Class>


OBO Typedefs
------------

In an OBO text file these have the [Typedef] stanza. In OBO-XML these
have a <typedef> element.

Mapping Typedefs is much the same as mapping Terms

Typedefs generally correspond to <owl:ObjectProperty> or
<owl:TransitiveProperty> depending on whether the obo file has the tag
'is_transitive' set

Typedef 'is_a:' tags are mapped to <rdfs:subPropertyOf>

OBO typedefs in which the range is an xsd datatype should be mapped to
a owl:DatatypeProperty. This is not currently done in the mapping
(this extension to the obo model was only introduced in 1.2 and is not
yet in widespread use)


The OBO 1.2 format has introduced tags corresponding to the following
owl or rdfs properties:

 - rdfs:domain    (domain tag)
 - rdfs:range     (range tag)
 - owl:inverseOf  (inverse_of tag)

These are currently ignored in the existing mapping implementation -
this will be fixed in a future version.

The OBO text and xml formats are extensible, and we may decide to add
extra tags to allow us to represent these things.

The following OBO typedef stanza tags have no OWL equivalent:

 - is_cyclic
 - is_symmetric
 - is_antisymmetric


OBO Names
-----------

An OBO term must have a 'name:' tag. This is the <name> element in
OBO-XML

OBO names are mapped to rdfs:label, which is a  sub-element of <owl:Class>

OBO Natural Language Definitions
--------------------------------

OBO terms have optional human-readable text definitions; this is the
'def:' tag and is represented as <definition> in OBO-XML

definitions are currently mapped to <rdfs:comment>

Note that this is not ideal - a comment is more general than a
definition. This will be fixed in future to use an
owl:AnnotationProperty

OBO Metadata
------------

OBO ontologies typically have a lot of metadata associated with each
term. This includes comments, the text definition, as well references
for the definition. Terms can also have typed synonyms, and terms can
have analogs (not necessarily equivalent) in other ontologies. Terms
can be marked obsolete yet remain "in the ontology".

Currently the mapping excludes much of the obo-format metadata.

In future, we will introduce AnnotationProperties for these

OBO Instances
-------------

Obo-format allows instance data to be specified. This is not yet in
use. The mapping to OWL has still to be specified here and in the XSLT.

Subclassing
-------------

The tag 'is_a:' is part of the OBO specification; it appears within the
[Term] stanza, and corresponds to the element <is_a> in OBO-XML. The
value of this tag is the Id for the parent term

'is_a' is mapped to <rdfs:subClassOf>, with the Id for the parent term
going in the attribute rdf:resource (with ':' mapped to '_')

If an 'is_a:' tag or element appears in an OBO typedef, this is mapped
to <rdfs:subPropertyOf>

Relationships
---------------

Relationships other than the axiomatic 'is_a' in OBO are represnted
with the 'relationship:' tag in OBO, and corresponds to
<relationship> in OBO-XML

Relationships have two sub-fields: the relationship type, and the
object of the relationship (the subject of the relationship is the
enclosing term)

In OBO-XML, these fields are mapped to the elements <type> and <to>
respectively (type is the name of the relationship type, to is the
parent ID)

In OWL, OBO relationships other than 'is_a' are mapped to subclasses of
retrictions that are existentially qualified (someValuesFrom).

Currently the OBO format does not make a distinction between
existentially or universally qualified relationships. We assume they
are all existentially qualified. This is in line with the definition
provided in:

 - http://obo.sourceforge.net/relationship[OBO-Relations]


As an example, the OWL represention of the relationship 'part_of
GO:0005933' looks like this:

----------------------------------------
            <rdfs:subClassOf>
                <owl:Restriction>
                    <owl:onProperty rdf:resource='part_of'></owl:onProperty>
                    <owl:someValuesFrom rdf:resource='GO_0005933'></owl:hasClass>
                </owl:Restriction>
            </rdfs:subClassOf>
----------------------------------------

These relations must be defined - see documentation on
mapping [Typedef]s

We reserve a 3rd subfield of the relationship: tag for these kind of
extensions; this will probably be a {} or [] enclosed list of
axiomatic qualifiers and tag-values (i.e. they will be part of the
OBO spec). These qualifiers and tag-values will most likely correspond
to the OWL equivalents (eg minCardinality:, cardinality:, etc). This
has not yet been finalised.

Class definitions
-----------------

Most OBO ontologies only provide necessary conditions for class
membership (i.e. the relationship: tag). The OBO 1.2 format also
allows for necessary and sufficient conditions using the
intersection_of: tag, which maps to owl:intersectionOf. This is
commonly refered to in the OBO community as 'cross-products'

As part of the Obol project, we are curating DL style definitions for
GO biological process classes that involve types of cells. Information
will be posted here:

- http://www.berkeleybop.org/obol[Obol]

You can also find uncurated automatically generared DL definitions for
GO and the plant ontology at the above URL (in both OBO and OWL
formats)

In practice we will usually have 'aristotelian definitions' in OBO:
these are terms defined by a *core* or *principal* term and one or
more *differentiating characteristics* (also known as defining
'species' from 'genus' and 'differentiae', although these terms are
overloaded in biology!)

Other OWL constructs
--------------------

We will add mappings for unions, disjointess axioms as
required. Currently no OBO ontologies have these.

Tools
-----

Currently the go-perl library contains scripts and modules for converting
between OBO,GO-legacy, OBO-XML and OWL.

- http://search.cpan.org/~cmungall/go-perl[GO-Perl]

go-perl uses the oboxml-to-owl XSL file.

OBO-Edit also has an OWL writer, although its mapping may differ from
the one provided here

FAQ
-----

Why use OBO (text or XML) rather than OWL as the primary format?

- not (so) human readable

- not (so) human editable

- bulkier

- not well suited for CVS management

- too complex for typical bioinformatics applications to handle; most
bio apps just want to get at basic DAG structure

- issues with metaclasses, OWL Full

- RDF mapping ugly (mapping IDs)

- RDF not easily amenable to XML tools (eg XSLT)

- we can convert back and forth to OWL anyway, using the XSLT, so we
have interoperability

- Using OWL commits us to using DLs. We think it is better to explore
DLs such as OWL using this transformation spec/tools, and retain the
option of not using them (instead using simple DAGs, or a
prototype-based formalism, or any other options)
