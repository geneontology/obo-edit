[Term]
id: GO:0000005
name: ribosomal chaperone activity
namespace: molecular_function
def: "OBSOLETE. Assists in the correct assembly of ribosomes or ribosomal subunits in vivo, but is not a component of the assembled ribosome when performing its normal biological function." [GOC:jl, PMID:12150913]
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to a class of gene products and a biological process rather than a molecular function.
is_obsolete: true
consider: GO:0042254
consider: GO:0051082

[Term]
id: GO:0000008
name: thioredoxin
namespace: molecular_function
alt_id: GO:0000013
def: "OBSOLETE. A small disulfide-containing redox protein that serves as a general protein disulfide oxidoreductase. Interacts with a broad range of proteins by a redox mechanism, based on the reversible oxidation of 2 cysteine thiol groups to a disulfide, accompanied by the transfer of 2 electrons and 2 protons. The net result is the covalent interconversion of a disulfide and a dithiol." [GOC:kd]
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents gene products.
is_obsolete: true
consider: GO:0030508

[Term]
id: GO:0000020
name: negative regulation of recombination within rDNA repeats
namespace: biological_process
def: "OBSOLETE. Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of genetic recombination within the DNA of the genes coding for ribosomal RNA." [GOC:go_curators, ISBN:0198506732 "Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"]
comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes a substrate-specific process.
is_obsolete: true
consider: GO:0045950

[Term]
id: GO:0000039
name: plasma membrane long-chain fatty acid transporter
namespace: molecular_function
def: "OBSOLETE (was not defined before being made obsolete)." [GOC:ai]
comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes a gene product and it contains component information.
is_obsolete: true

[Term]
id: GO:0000174
name: inactivation of MAPK (mating sensu Saccharomyces)
namespace: biological_process
def: "OBSOLETE. Downregulation of MAP kinase activity in the context of transduction of mating pheromone signal, as described for Saccharomyces." [PMID:9561267]
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a gene product specific term.

[Term]
id: GO:0000259
name: intracellular nucleoside transmembrane transporter activity
namespace: molecular_function
def: "OBSOLETE. Enables the directed movement of a nucleoside, a nucleobase linked to either beta-D-ribofuranose (ribonucleoside) or 2-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranose (a deoxyribonucleotide) within a cell." [GOC:ai]

[Term]
id: GO:0000260
name: hydrogen-translocating V-type ATPase activity
