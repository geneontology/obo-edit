name: cell phenotype
namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
def: "A phenotype that is observed at the level of an individual cell." [PomBase:mah]
comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will seldom be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype.

name: viability
namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
def: "A cell phenotype that consists of the cell's disposition to survive and develop normally." [PomBase:mah]
comment: Viability is usually determined under standard laboratory conditions, i.e. a cell is generally considered viable if it can grow in rich medium under normal conditions such as temperature, pressure, oxygen level, pH, etc.
