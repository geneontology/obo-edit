go-perl modules
===============

This is a collection of perl code for dealing with GO and OBO style
ontologies. It is part of the go-dev distribution, but can be used
independently. The code contains both scripts (which can be used with
no knowledge of perl), and libraries which will be of use to perl
programmers using GO or OBO.
