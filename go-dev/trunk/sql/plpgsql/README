hack some way to query GO graph up or down in 2 db calls.
currently (v 7.2), postgres can not return query result set (m rows of n fields) using plpqsql.

To use these functions, you have to install plpgsql for your GO database
by running 'createlang 'plpgsql' dbname' from command line or from inside psql shell;
and load the function by '\i script_file_name;' inside psql shell or by loading it from command line.

these functions put all results in temp table (which is only visible to the current db session),
so you could get them by selection query from the temp table, whose name is returned from the function call.
to repeat use the same function in one session, make sure to drop the temp table (until we figure out
how to find out if the table existence in plpqsl so we do drop table inside the function itself).
e.g. (pseudo code!)
	$tblname = select r2ld(58);
	select * from $tblname;
