//
schema: go
desc: given a GO term, fetch other GO terms associated with the SAME gene_product.
      will also summarise the number of gene_products each pair shares in common,
      in the gene_product/number_of_gps field

      For example, term_name = ribosome and correlated_term_name = protein biosynthesis
      should yeild a high value for number_of_gps, since these terms are
      biologically correlated

      This is similar to the template "go-correlations" - the
      difference is that this traverses the graph using the graph_path
      transitive closure table

      if xml output is chosen, gene_products will be nested inside
      each term pair; nested inside each <gene_product> is the
      graph_path table entry showing the transitive relationship
      between the term that the gene_product was annotated to and
      either of the two chosen terms

      BE WARNED: if not constrained correctly, this could take a LONG TIME
      to finish
