  This is an experimental/explorative template

  The GO Database contains redundant annotations of the same genes
  from different sources - notable GOA UniProt and the model organism
  databases. These annotations will be to distinct gene_products with
  distinct dbxrefs (either UniProt protein accessions or model
  organism IDs), although they may represent the same gene. We unify
  these by linking from the model organism gene_product through their
  sequence to the dbxrefs for that sequences - this should match the
  UniProt sequence (in cases where sequences have been provided).

  The purpose of this query is to group these genes and compare
  annotation from these two different sources.
