== Creating the Database ==

You can either use a database obtained from the download area as a shell, or you can use the SQL DDL provided in the modules above. The SQL provided is in a RDBMS-neutral dialect, and will not work directly in MySQL. Use the compiledb script; or use the go-manager.pl script

== Loading the Database ==

the load-go.pl script can be used to populate the database with a
variety of data from standard GO/OBO flat files. To use this, you will
need to install go-db-perl
