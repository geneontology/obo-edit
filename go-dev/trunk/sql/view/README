Views are virtual tables - they are intensional rather than
extensional. i.e. their contents are determined dynamically at query
time.

Views allow for simplification of SQL queries by allowing common
patterns to be captured and named.

The views are arranged in a modular fashion, and named go-*.sql

Implementation of views in slow in MySQL, so it is sometimes necessary
to materialize views. See the code in sql/util.

Materialization commands are stored as comments in the main view SQL
definition files. The Makefile translates these and generated the
materialized-*.mysql files.
