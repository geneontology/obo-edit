This is a set of scripts to to setup the GO-Schema under oracle and
load GO into it.

You first have to create a schema in Oracle to create the tables in.
Unless schema, user and password are all go, you should set the
foloowing environment variables to their correct values:

GO_ROOT
GO_DATABASE_USER
GO_DATABASE_AUTH
GO_DATABASE_HOST

* oracle_go.sh is the main script creating and loading the oracle
  database. Invoke it with "./oracle_go.sh sql-dump-datafile".

* compiledb is an extension of the one provided by GO. Data type
  mappings for Oracle are explained in the comments.

* go-drop-all.sql is a script to drop the stuff you created, since
  there are no "databases" in oracle and maybe you do not want to drop
  the whole schema.

* get_table_cols.pl is a helper script to figure out a field
  definition list for sql loader.

You will get some complaints about indices, this is because Oracle
automatically creates indices for the primary key fields, so they
already exist when GO tries to create them. I guess for the purpose of
creating a schema diagram and loading the data (as for most other)
this doesnt hurt.
