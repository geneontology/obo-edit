go-dev/doc - website documents
==============================

This README describes the structure of the go-dev website documents

Each of the go-dev components has its own "mini-website"; eg

go-dev/
        go-perl/doc/go-perl-doc.html
        go-db-perl/doc/go-db-perl-doc.html
        xml/doc/xml-doc.html
        sql/doc/godb-sql-doc.html

These are mostly self-contained. go-dev/doc has general documentation
connecting these, via a frame-based navigationbar (www-navbar.html)
and a general documentation page (www-intro.html)

Installing the documentation
----------------------------

The documents live at http://www.godatabase.org/dev

This URL should just point to the actual go-dev directory; the
structure of go-dev in cvs should mirror exactly the structure on the
website.

eg

+++
cvs checkout go-dev
mkdir $HTTP_DOCUMENT_ROOT/dev
cp -pR go-dev/* $HTTP_DOCUMENT_ROOT/dev
+++

The website should now be browsable, but you still need to add db
downloads and the html-ized perl pod documentation

POD Docs
~~~~~~~~

The perl POD documentation should be browsable at

 http://www.godatabase.org/dev/pod

The main go-perl documentation is in the go-perl.pod, browsable here:

 http://www.godatabase.org/dev/pod/go-perl.html

Here is how to install the pod documentation

+++
mkdir $HTTP_DOCUMENT_ROOT/dev/pod
cd ~/go-dev/go-perl
perl Makefile.PL
make pod
cp -pR pod/* $HTTP_DOCUMENT_ROOT/dev/pod

cd ~/go-dev/go-db-perl
perl Makefile.PL
make pod
cp -pR pod/* $HTTP_DOCUMENT_ROOT/dev/pod
+++

This installs both go-perl and go-db-perl docs in the same place

Database downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The database downloads are available here:

 http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/archive

The directory 'archive' is not in cvs - this is maintained
manually. All db releases by date should be placed here. There should
be a symbolic link called 'latest' pointing to the most recent one (so
apache symlinks should be turned on)

*TODO* make this an ftp-browsable archive rather than http & change
the appropriate links


Apache settings
---------------

 - FollowSymLinks should be turned on (at BDGP)
 - Indexes should be turned on
 - directory browsing should be turned on
