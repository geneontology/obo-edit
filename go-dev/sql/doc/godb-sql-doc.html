    <h1>GO Database Schema</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      The GO Database Schema Modules are designed for housing any GO
      or OBO style ontology together with associated annotations and
      other auxhiliary data.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can download the latest release of the MySQL Database from
      the <a href="http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/">GO Database
      Website</a>, or you can build your own from the components here
    </p>

    <h2>
      Background
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      You should already be familiar with the Gene Ontology project:
      
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <a target="_top" href="http://www.geneontology.org">http://www.geneontology.org</a>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a target="_top" href="http://obo.sourceforge.net">http://obo.sourcefore.net</a>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a
	    target="_top" href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.contents.doc.shtml">GO
	    documentation</a>
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      GO Database and Developers page:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <a target="_top"
	  href="http://www.godatabase.org/dev/doc/www-intro.html">http://www.godatabase.org/dev</a>
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You should also be familiar with relational databases and
      SQL. In particular, you should be familiar with MySQL. You
      should be able to use other RDBMSs if required, but currently
      MySQL is the only one supported.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a good tutorial on relational databases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a
             href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~wrp/papers/ismb02_sql.pdf">Relational Databases for Biologists</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
      You should already have MySQL installed. Obtain a copy of the GO
      database from the <a
      href="http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/">download area</a>
      and import the MySQL dump.
    </p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <h3>Directed Graphs</h3>
    <p>
      The central concept in OBO style ontologies and in the GO
      database is the <i>graph</i>. The GO or OBO terms are
      <i>nodes</i> in the graph, and the relationships between them
      are <i>arcs</i>. This is handled by the tables <b>term</b> and
      <b>term2term</b> respectively.
    </p>
    <p>A graph</p>
    <img src="example-graph.png"></img>

    <p>
      An alternative view is that GO or OBO style ontologies consist
      of <i>binary relationships</i>, that is some kind of typed
      relationship between two entities.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Relationship types</h3>
    
    <p>
      Currently there are few relationship types in OBO ontologies
      (is_a, part_of, and develops_from in anatomical
      ontologies). This may change in the future - we may wish to have
      a large variety of relationship types, with some being
      specialisations of others. To support this, we store
      relationship types in the same table we use for storing
      terms. We differentiate these by the fact that they come from
      the relationship type ontology.
    </p>


    <h3>Traversing Graphs</h3>

    <p>
      When performing ontology oriented queries, it is often necessary
      to do some kind of graph traversal. It is possible to use the
      <b>term2term</b> table to iterate through the graph, but this
      requires mutliple SQL calls. Most implementations of SQL do not
      support the kind of <i>recursive</i> querying required to answer
      queries such as <b>find all <i>DNA binding</i> genes</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This kind of query <i>is</i> possible with the GO database
      however, because we <i>precompute</i> the path from every node
      to all of its ancestors (which is equivalent to computing the
      path from every node to all of its descendents). This is known
      as the <i>transitive closure</i> of a relationship. This goes in
      the <b>graph_path</b> table, which also holds the distance
      between terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, we calculate the <i>reflexive</i> transitive
      closure, which means that every term is related to itself (the
      distance between the terms is zero). In practical terms, this
      makes it easier to write queries such as <b>find all <i>DNA
      binding</i> genes</b> - because such queries should return genes
      attached directly to DNA binding, as well as to children of DNA
      binding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The diagram below shows an example of the reflexive transitive
      closure of <b>DNA helicase</b> and its ancestors. The dark lines
      indicate direct <b>is_a</b> relationships (stored in the
      term2term table); the dotted lines indicate the implied
      ancestral relationships (ie the closure), which is stored in the
      <b>graph_path</b> table.
      <img src="transitive_closure.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Surrogate keys</h3>

    <p>
      The GO database uses <i>surrogate keys</i> to link tables
      together. These keys have no meaning, and are different from
      accession numbers. For example, the term table has fields
      <b>id</b> and <b>acc</b>. The <b>id</b> field should be used for
      joining the tables, the <b>acc</b> field for storing the OBO
      accession.
    </p>

    <h2>Modules</h2>

    <p>

      The GO schema has a modular design. Hopefully this makes it
      easier to familiarize yourself with the schema. It should also
      make it easier to combine the GO db with existing database
      schemas. You can safely ignore modules you are not interested
      in, provided there are no other dependencies on this module

    <h3>Browse the modules</h3>
    <p>
      You can browse the sql module directory <a href="../modules/">here</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Building your own Database</h2>
      <p>
	You may wish to create an instance of the GO database with
	your own data in it -- for example, using a custom phenotype
	ontology, or adding your own gene associations.
      </p>


    <h3>Creating the Database</h3>
    <p>
      You can either use a database obtained from the download area as
      a shell, or you can use the SQL DDL provided in the modules
      above. The SQL provided is in a RDBMS-neutral dialect, and will
      not work directly in MySQL. Use the <a
	href="../ifx2mysql.pl">conversion</a> script provided; or use
      the go-manager.pl script
    </p>

    <h3>Loading the Database</h3>
      <p>
	the load-go.pl script can be used to populate the database
	with a variety of data from standard GO/OBO flat files. To use
	this, you will need to install <a
	href="../../go-db-perl/">go-db-perl</a>; see the instructions
	for more details
      </p>

    <h2>Querying the database</h2>

    <p>Once you have a local copy of the database, there are a number
      of ways to query it</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Local copy of AmiGO
      </dt>
      <dd>
	You can install AmiGO as a local CGI script, and issue web queries
      </dd>   
      
      <dt>Direct MySQL queries
      </dt>
      <dd>
	You can use the mysql command line interface to issue queries
      </dd>   
      
      <dt>Query via the perl API
      </dt>
      <dd>
	You will need <a href="../../go-db-perl/">go-db-perl</a> for
	this </dd>
      
      <dt>Query via your own code
      </dt>
      <dd>
	You can write your own code to query the db, using a database
	driver such as DBI or JDBC
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Query via DBStag <b>(EXPERIMENTAL)</b>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	You can use the <a href="http://stag.sf.net">stag</a> module
	for issuing queries to the GO db and getting back XML. You can
	query with arbitrary SQL, or use the <a
	href="../stag-templates">stag templates</a> provided (see <a
	href="../stag-templates/README">README</a>). <!-- Query via
	<a
	href="http://www.godatabase.org/cgi-bin/ubiq-go/ubiq.cgi">stag
	www demo on GO</a> -->
      </dd>

    </dl>

    <h2>Example Queries</h2>
    <p>
      There is a page of <a href="example-queries.html">example
	queries</a> to help you out.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Directions</h2>

    <h3>Chado</h3>
      <p>
      The GO database design influenced the design of the <a
	href="http://www.gmod.org">GMOD/Chado</a> controlled
      vocabulary and ontology module. We may decide to switch to the
      chado schema when we make the transition to AmiGO 2.0
      </p>

    <h3>PostgreSQL</h3>
    <p>
      We may switch to an underlying postgres database as opposed to
      MySQL. When the GO Database project was started in 2000, MySQL
      was clearly the only viable open source database, despite its
      many limitations. More recently, PostgreSQL improved
      dramatically and supplied many of the things that MySQL lacked -
      transactions, views, procedures, triggers, subselects. As of
      writing, MySQL is catching up with all these features one
      expects of a modern relational database. As yet, no final
      decision has been made as to whether to switch to
      PostgreSQL. We will never use a non-open source database, as
      we believe that the database should be available to as many
      users as possible
    </p>
    
    <h3>Advanced Ontologies</h3>

    <p>
      The GO project may make the transition to more advanced ontology
      formalisms, for example a description logic such as OWL, or a
      frame based system such as that used by Protege.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is unlikely to affect the structure of the GO database, as
      the database is currently used purely for querying, not data
      management.
    </p>

    <h3>Advanced Annotation</h3>

    <p>
      Currently the annotation model supported by GO and the GO
      database is a simple one of disjunctive annotations; that is, if
      a gene is annotated to GO function F and component C, it does not
      necessarily mean that function F is happening in component C -
      the roles could be completely seperate.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may wish to allow for more complex terms such as <b>this gene
      has function F during process P whilst in cellular component
      C</b>. We may also want to allow <i>slot-based</i> annotations -
      for example, combining the terms from the function ontology with
      terms from the biochemical or protein ontology in constrained
      ways to make composite statements such as <i>interleukin-18
      biosynthesis</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      For the current proposal, please see the <b>assoc_rel</b> table
      in the go-associations module - more documentation to follow
    </p>
