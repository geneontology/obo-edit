//
schema: go
desc: given a GO term, fetch other GO terms associated with the same gene_product.
      will also summarise the number of gene_products each pair shares in common,
      in the gene_product/number_of_gps field

      For example, term_name = ribosome and correlated_term_name = protein biosynthesis
      should yeild a high value for number_of_gps, since these terms are
      biologically correlated

      does not use graph structure (direct associations only)
