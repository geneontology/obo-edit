Subject: [Go-database] SQLParse MySQL 2 SQL Server version 0.1 (alfa)

    [ The following text is in the "iso-8859-1" character set. ]
    [ Your display is set for the "US-ASCII" character set.  ]
    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]

At http://www.medfac.leidenuniv.nl/lgtc/db/unigene/dbtool.html
is the first Alfa version available of the mYSQL 2 MS SQL
syntax parser. It is a executable binary release complied
file under win32 console application compiled under NT4,
but it should be executable under any win32 system.

Just download the executable type the command name in a
console followed by input file as arg1 and oputput file
as arg2.

BE AWARE!

This is an Alfa release (mean I still need to do some white
box testing, and it might still lacks some fault tolerant and
defensive programming stuff).

In short: it comes AS IT IS, run the program on your own risk!

No guarantee is given what so ever about the program, nor its
output.

All memory leaks, blue screens, etc, etc are still features
of the program, and might be fixed in the future.

Right now it is just a fast "thrown together" thing such as
an end user also can use the program, that is: people who
still haven't learnt how to use a decent compiler. =)

Also, the program does read from file, but does (currently)
not write to file, but to the stdout (usually the console window).

How ever, this is easily solved by executing the program
in this fashion:

SQLParse YOURE_INPUT_FILE_NAME ANYTHING > OUTPUT_FILE_NAME

I would appreciate if someone would like to beta test the
program for me.

Anyhow,
Have fun!
