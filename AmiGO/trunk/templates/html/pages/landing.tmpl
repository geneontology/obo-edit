  <h2>About AmiGO 2</h2>

  <p>
    AmiGO 2 is currently a development project to create the next
    generation of AmiGO--the current official web-based set of tools
    for searching and browsing the Gene Ontology database. It is still
    under active development, with a demonstrations site available at
    http://amigo2.berkeleybop.org. Please be aware that this site
    changes frequently and may still have downtimes (see the
    AmiGO_Labs page for the usual caveats).
