! The above "Submission Date" is when the annotation project provided
! this file to the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC).  The "GOC Validation
! Date" indicates when this file was last changed as a result of a GOC
! validation and filtering process.  The "CVS Version" above is the
! GOC version of this file.

! Note: The contents of this file may differ from that submitted to the

! data not meeting the standards set by the GOC have been removed. This
! file may also have annotations removed because the annotations for the

! 128up: This one should result in a F->P IC (GTP Binding -> guanyly nb -> purine nb -> purine deoxy biosynth)
! fake1: no IC here, due to IEA
! fake2: no IC here as it would be redundant with more specific P annotation
! fake3: no IC here as it would be redundant with P annotation
