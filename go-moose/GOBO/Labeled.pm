=head1 NAME

GOBO::Labeled

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A role for any kind of entity that can have a human-readable label
attached: both primary label and alternate labels (GOBO::Synonym)

For genes the primary label is a symbol. For GOBO::TermNode objects
(units in an ontology) it is the class name

=head2 TBD

Is this over-abstraction? This could be simply mixed in with Node
