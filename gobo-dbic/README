Testing:
If you wish to have tests done, you must at least make sure that the
variables GO_DBNAME and GO_DBHOST are in your environemt. Otherwise,
some tests will be ignored.

Debian:
The module seems ready to be used by dh-make-perl to package. If there
are any problems, please contact the upstream maintainer.
