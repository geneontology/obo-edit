<h2>Use Case 5: Annotated entities of interest (EOI)</h2>

<h3>See Also</h3
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
To obtain annotations for some entity of interest in the domain. Here <i>entity</i> denotes anything that
can exist in the domain of interest, from information entities such as images, documents, test results,
investigation eligibility criteria through to biological entities such as organisms/patients, genes,
genotypes and other genetic entities to cells and molecules. Entities can be types or instances.
</p>
 
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The user arrives at an EOI (entity of interest) in BioPortal via different means, including:
<ul>
 <li>
  A BioPortal search; for example a search for <b>BRCA1</b> will return gene entities matching this search. Note that this may
  include both classes in ontologies (eg NCIT) and types as represented non-ontologically in external databases. The latter will be
  included if they have been annotated
 </li>
 <li>
  Following a bioportal link from an annotation results page. See <@usecase id="1"/>
 </li>
</ul>
